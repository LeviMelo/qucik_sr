Gabapentin is used for treating postoperative pain and preventing neuropathic pain. We aimed to examine the effects of gabapentin on opioid use and neuropathic pain following minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum with intercostal nerve cryoablation (MIRPE-INC). A prospective comparison study was conducted among patients ≤21 years old undergoing MIRPE-ICN. Patients were grouped based on perioperative gabapentin use (gabapentin beginning 2 weeks prior to MIRPE-INC from March 2021 to December 2022 and no-gabapentin cohorts from June 2023 to June 2024). Participants underwent chest wall sensory examination and neuropathic pain screening (S-LANSS) pre-MIRPE and post-MIRPE (postoperative day 1 (POD1), 2 weeks, 2 months). S-LANSS score ≥12 was suggestive of neuropathic pain. Additionally, inpatient opioid use, inpatient pain scores, and length of stay (LOS) were recorded. Outcomes were compared between cohorts. Of the 112 patients enrolled, 39 received perioperative gabapentin and 73 did not. Age, Haller index, correction index, and BMI were similar between cohorts. The gabapentin cohort was less likely to have neuropathic pain symptoms (S-LANNS ≥12) on POD1 (11.4 % vs 31.9 %, p = 0.023). At 2 weeks and 2 months postoperatively, the frequency of s-LANSS scores ≥12 was similar between treatment groups, as was the incidence of hyperesthesia on chest wall sensory examination. Total inpatient oral morphine equivalents were similar between cohorts. Perioperative gabapentin use was associated with a decreased incidence of neuropathic pain symptoms immediately post-MIRPE-INC but did not decrease perioperative opioid use or LOS. Gabapentin did not decrease neuropathic pain symptoms outside the immediate perioperative period. Level 2.

Intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) during the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) provides effective post-operative analgesia; long-term neurosensory effects of MIRPE/INC remain unclear. The study aimed to compare chest wall sensation at pectus-bar removal in patients who previously had MIRPE with and without INC. We conducted a multi-institutional prospective study of patients ≤21 who underwent MIRPE with and without INC between 1/11/2021-8/18/2024. Chest wall sensory testing was performed pre-bar removal, and at 2 weeks and 2 months post-bar removal. Demographics and operative details of MIRPE were reviewed. Chest wall hypoesthesia to stimulation were compared between groups. 166 participants were enrolled (male - 86 %, mean age - 18.3 ± 1.7 years at bar removal, median duration of bar implantation - 3.0 [IQR:2.9-3.1] years) INC was performed in 78 % (n = 130) during MIRPE. Compared to no-INC, INC patients were more likely to have >1 pectus bar (82 % vs 47 %, p < 0.001) and pericostal suture fixation (85 % vs 44 %, p = 0.004). Prior to bar removal, chest wall hypoesthesia in ≥1 dermatome was found in 58 % of INC vs 50 % of no-INC (p = 0.451). At two month follow up 85 % of patients had normal chest wall sensation (85 % INC vs 95 % no-INC, p = 0.460). Hypoesthesia was associated with >1 pectus bar implanted. Three years following MIRPE, hypoesthesia to 1-2 dermatomes in the region of the pectus bar(s) is present in nearly half of patients and is not associated with intercostal nerve cryoablation. Following bar removal, chest wall sensation is normal in approximately 80 % of all patients.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature-reported outcomes of CRYO compared to standard of care without CRYO (non-CRYO) after PEx repair. Surgical repair of pectus excavatum (PEx) via the Nuss or Ravitch procedures is associated with substantial postoperative pain. Intercostal nerve cryoablation (CRYO) performed during the primary surgical repair has been adopted as a non-opioid modality for pain management. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and using additional online approaches to identify comparative studies of patients undergoing the Nuss or Ravitch procedure for PEx repair with CRYO versus non-CRYO between years 2014-24. Meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively evaluate primary outcomes of hospital length of stay (LOS) and opioid consumption. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs and complications, summarized qualitatively. Of 178 studies, 32 comparative studies encompassing 13,103 patients were included; 28% (n=3,620) received CRYO. Random effects meta-analyses demonstrated a significantly shortened LOS by 1.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.12, -1.42) and a significant reduction in inpatient and outpatient opioid consumption with CRYO by 186 morphine mg equivalents (MME) (95% CI: -262.26, -109.08) and 147 MME (95% CI: -255.72, -38.26), respectively. Complications with CRYO were either decreased or similar between groups and resolved over time. Hospital costs were similar. This systematic review suggests CRYO during PEx repair is associated with a significantly shorter hospital LOS, as well as decreased opioid consumption both in the hospital and after discharge. Complications were infrequent and time-limited.

Minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum is the accepted standard approach for correction of pectus excavatum. This procedure is associated with significant postoperative pain, which is the dominant factor determining the duration of hospitalization. To date, a multitude of analgesic modalities are used, however, the most effective is to be corroborated. The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate and compare all available analgesic modalities for pain management after minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum through a network meta-analysis. Electronic scientific databases were systematically searched. Articles were eligible for inclusion when designed as a comparative study evaluating perioperative pain management techniques for patients undergoing minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum and where length of hospitalization was reported as an outcome. Data concerning length of hospitalization were extracted and submitted for network meta-analysis. Thirty-nine studies were included, enrolling 4241 patients. Through a network meta-analysis intercostal nerve cryoablation with an adjunct analgesic intervention (e.g., intercostal nerve block or patient controlled analgesia) showed a statistically significant reduction in the length of hospitalization ranging from 0.9 days (95 % confidence interval (CI): -1.7 to -0.1) when compared to locoregional blocks with an adjunct analgesic intervention to 2.5 days (95 % CI: -3.7 to -1.3) when compared to thoracic epidural analgesia. Regarding postoperative pain management after minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum, intercostal nerve cryoablation with adjunct analgesic intervention is more effective in terms of length of hospitalization compared to other forms of analgesia. Systemic review and meta analysis.

Pectus excavatum is the most common congenital chest wall deformity, occurring in 1 in 250-300 live births. Surgical correction of this pathology is traditionally associated with significant pain. We hypothesize intercostal nerve cryoablation is a superior analgesic modality that can improve patient comfort, improve healthcare resource utilization, and reduce opioid exposure in a high-risk population. The most recently published National Readmissions Database (2016-2020) was queried for patient aged 12-21 years old who underwent Nuss Procedure for pectus excavatum. Patient demographics, hospital factors, and patient outcomes including hospital length of stay, opioid-related complications, readmission, post-operative acute pain, respiratory complications, post-operative bleeding, chest tube insertion, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and hospital costs were analyzed. 818 patients were analyzed in this study. 62 % received epidural/regional analgesia and 38 % received intercostal nerve cryoablation. The mean age in the cohort was 16 ± 2 years old. 86 % of the study cohort was male. Intercostal nerve cryoablation was associated with significantly reduced opioid-related complications (4.3 % vs 8.7 %, p = 0.015), hospital length of stay (2 [2-3] vs 4 [3-5] days, p < 0.001), and respiratory failure when compared to epidural analgesia. Intercostal nerve cryoablation was associated with an increased index hospitalization cost when compared to epidural/regional analgesia ($17,656 [15,103-23,346] vs. $15,669 [12,676-20,177], p < 0.001). Intercostal nerve cryoablation for pectus excavatum repair is a safe analgesic modality that is associated with superior pain control while reducing opioid-related complications, respiratory failure, and hospital length of stay.

To decrease diversion of unused opioids following the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE), we developed an opioid education monitoring and reclamation program. The aim was to evaluate outpatient opioid use and disposal following MIRPE. A retrospective review was conducted at a single center among patients <19 ys who underwent MIRPE with intercostal nerve cryoablation. Demographic and clinical data, including outpatient opioid prescriptions, were reviewed. Patients or families were educated on the risk of opioids and encouraged to bring unused opioid to the first postoperative visit for disposal. Questionnaires were administered on opioid use and disposal plan. A total of 72 patients participated in the program: 83.3% (60/72) were male, and the mean age was 15.2 ± 1.6 ys old. A median of 10 tablets per patient were prescribed, with a total of 790 five-mg oxycodone tablets prescribed. Prior to the first postoperative visit, 20.8% (15/72) of patients required an opioid refill. Patients reported using a median of 5 [IQR: 1.6 - 10], five-mg oxycodone tablets for a median of 5 [IQR: 2 - 6.7] ds: 92% (65/72) had unused opioids totaling 420 tablets. Of patients with unused opioid, 50.8% (33/65) reported a plan for opioid disposal, 30.8% (20/65) reported a plan to keep unused opioids, and 28.5% (12/65) did not disclose a plan of disposal. Despite conservative opioid prescribing, 53% of outpatient opioids go unused following MIRPE. After education on opioid risks and providing a convenient means for safe opioid disposal, half of the patients or families intended to dispose of unused opioids.

Pectus excavatum is a common congenital chest wall abnormality characterized by a concave appearance of the chest, and minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) is the surgical treatment of choice. A rapidly growing field of research is pain management in children undergoing MIRPE, with many shifts in practice occurring over the last decade. The primary objectives of this narrative review are to describe current methods of perioperative pain management and the development of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) to improve the experience of patients undergoing MIRPE. Recent literature was found using the PubMed database using combinations of keywords: pectus excavatum, pediatric, pain management, minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE), and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). Literature search was conducted by the authorship team and an independent, certified librarian. Articles published in English from 2010-2024 were the focus of our review; however, older literature was included when appropriate. Perioperative pain management for patients undergoing MIRPE continues to evolve and improve patient outcomes. While evidence supports the use of more traditional analgesia, such as opioid-based or epidural analgesia, it also supports the trend toward contemporary multimodal pain control via pre-, intra-, and post-operative strategies including opioid-sparing analgesics, intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC), intercostal nerve blocks (INBs), and single or continuous infusion regional anesthesia techniques. Patients undergoing surgical repair of pectus excavatum benefit from the use of contemporary pain control techniques discussed in this review, with a growing body of literature supporting the use of INC, regional pain blocks and multimodal analgesia. Additionally, ERAS pathways and institutional protocols are discussed that are currently transforming postoperative MIRPE pain management and are being implemented widely.

Erector spinae plane (ESP) blocks, thoracic epidural, and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) have all been used for perioperative pain management in the Nuss procedure without a consensus on what modality produces the best outcomes. Intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) is a relatively new modality that involves freezing the nerves to prevent pain during recovery. Our hypothesis is that using INC for the Nuss procedure will decrease opioid use, pain scores, and length of stay (LOS) but will increase cost compared with ESP block, thoracic epidural, and PCA. This retrospective, observational study compared 108 patients who underwent the Nuss procedure at a pediatric acute care children's hospital in the southeast US. Patient charts were evaluated for significant differences in LOS, opioid use, and reported pain ratings based on type of analgesia administered: INC (n = 30), ESP block (n = 19), thoracic epidural (n = 41), and PCA (n = 18). Secondary variables included emergency department visits, readmissions, opioid refills, and various anesthetic and operative costs. Analysis of variance was performed on all outcome measures. Average LOS was significantly decreased in the INC group (2.9 days) compared with the thoracic epidural (4.7 days, p < 0.05) and the PCA groups (3.7 days, p < 0.05). Average cumulative opioid use was significantly decreased in the INC group (50.4 morphine milligram equivalents [MME]) compared with the thoracic epidural (117 MME, p < 0.05) and PCA groups (172.1 MME, p < 0.05). This study suggests that INC can be a viable and cost-effective option for reducing postoperative opioid consumption and LOS in Nuss procedure patients. Pain perception was lower in the INC group compared with the rest of the groups, except the epidurals, which were similar. However, the opioid consumption of the INC group was significantly lower than any other group. Despite the INC group having higher initial costs, it did not result in the highest total hospital charges, indicating its potential cost-effectiveness. There is a need for larger prospective randomized controlled trials to guide future research efforts.

Intercostal nerve cryoablation during minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) is an effective pain control technique. Some insurers may not reimburse for cryoablation in this context, contending that it's an experimental procedure. This study aimed to describe national trends in cryoablation use and evaluate outcomes and predictors of its use. The Pediatric Health Information System database was queried for pectus excavatum patients aged 9-21 who underwent MIRPE between 2016 and 2023. Concurrent cryoablation use was identified using billing/supply codes. Temporal trends in cryoablation utilization were described and quantified using linear regression. Demographics, resource utilization, and outcomes were compared for patients based on cryoablation utilization using chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Predictors of cryoablation use were evaluated with logistic regression. This analysis included 2068 patients (mean age 15 ± 1.8 years; 86 % male). Cryoablation utilization increased from 33 % to 61 % from 2016 to 2023, with a strong positive trend (R2 = 0.73). Cryoablation patients had fewer surgical complications (8 % vs 12 %, p = 0.004), shorter LOS (2.0 ± 1.3 vs. 2.8 ± 1.6 days, p < 0.001), fewer total mean opiate days billed (1.4 ± 1.1 vs. 1.6 ± 1.4 days, p < 0.0001) and higher total costs ($24,045 ± $9696 vs. $20,751 ± $9,237, p < 0.001). High-volume centers (odds ratio (OR) 1.9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.2-3.0) and commercial HMO insurance (OR 2.7, 95 % CI 1.9-3.8) were predictors of cryoablation use. Cryoablation during MIRPE has increased nationally since 2016; now being performed in nearly two-thirds of all cases. Cryoablation should be considered a standard adjunct to MIRPE rather than an experimental technique.

Our institution recently transitioned from paravertebral nerve blocks (PVBs) to intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) for pain control following minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE). This study aimed to determine how INC affected the operative time, length of stay, complication rates, inpatient opioid use, and outpatient prescription of opioids at a single center. A retrospective review was performed at a single pediatric referral center of all patients who underwent MIRPE between 2018 and 2023. Patient demographics, operative details, and perioperative course were collected. The use of INC versus PVB was recorded. Univariate analyses were performed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables. 255 patients were included with a median age of 15 years, median BMI of 18.50 kg/m2, and median Haller index of 4.40. INC was utilized in 41% (105/255), and 59% (150/255) received PVB. The two groups did not differ significantly in BMI, Haller index, or complications, though the INC patients were older by 1 year (15.0 vs. 16.0, p = 0.034). INC was associated with an increased operative time (INC: 92 min vs. PVB: 67 min, p < 0.001), decreased length of stay (3 vs. 4 days, p =  < 0.001), more than twofold decrease in inpatient opioids per day (INC: 16 MME vs. PVB: 41 MME, p < 0.001), and a fourfold decrease in the amount of opioids prescribed at discharge (INC: 90 MME vs. PVB: 390 MME, p < 0.001). INC after MIRPE significantly decreased both the inpatient opioid utilization and our outpatient prescribing practices while also decreasing our overall length of stay without increasing complications.

Intercostal nerve cryoablation (CRYO) during the Nuss procedure is effective for postoperative pain control, but little is known about patterns of sensory recovery following its use. A single institution, prospective study of 121 patients undergoing Nuss bar placement with CRYO for pectus excavatum was conducted to assess sensory recovery. Patients received CRYO from T3-T8 and were followed at scheduled intervals. The primary outcome was time to return of normal chest wall sensation. Secondary outcomes included alterations in sensation, permanent numbness, and chronic neuropathic pain. Following CRYO, median time to normal sensation was 6.0 (range 1-12) months. This was achieved postoperatively by 14.9% at 3 months, 62.3% at 6 months, 85.1% at 9 months, and 98.3% at 12 months. 1.7% had a small area of persistent/permanent numbness in the lower central sternum. The most common altered sensation was hypersensitivity which occurred in 20.7%. Hypersensitivity began on average at 3.0 months postoperatively (range 0.25-6 months) and lasted a median of 1.0 (range 0.5-9) months. Only 5.8% described their altered sensation as painful, and all of these were successfully treated with gabapentin and/or capsaicin cream. All others resolved spontaneously. There were no cases of chronic neuropathic pain. Sensory recovery following CRYO is a slow process that ultimately leads to normal sensation in virtually all patients by one year. Hypersensitivity is more common than expected but is rarely described as painful and always resolves. Permanent numbness can occur but is very rare and limited in scope. Therapeutic.

Cardiac injury during the Nuss procedure is a rare risk that can lead to a catastrophic outcome. The specific aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of simultaneous bilateral thoracoscopy (SBT) compared to standard unilateral right thoracoscopy (RT) in children undergoing the Nuss procedure in order to mitigate that risk. IRB approval was obtained to analyze data on children who underwent SBT and RT during the Nuss procedure. Data retrieval included age, gender, Haller index (HI), operative time (OT), length of stay (LOS), complications and follow up. From August 2022 to August 2023, 10 children who underwent SBT were compared to 10 children who underwent RT. Both groups underwent intercostal nerve cryoablation. Following completion of cryoablation, SBT or RT was carried out during the Nuss procedure. SBT allowed for the tip of the bar passer to be visualized during the entire dissection in both thoraces. There was no significant difference in either group with respect to age, HI, OT, LOS. There were no anesthetic or surgical complications in either group. We found that SBT is safe, effective and allows for 100% visualization of the tip of the bar passer during the entire critical phase of the Nuss procedure. It does not impact OT or LOS compared to children who underwent only RT. SBT may benefit children who undergo the Nuss procedure by reducing the risk of cardiac injury.

To minimize unused outpatient opioids while providing adequate pain control, we sought to create a model to predict outpatient opioid use following the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum with cryoablation MIRPE-C. A retrospective review was conducted at a single center from May 2023 to January 2024 among patients <21 years who underwent MIPRE-C. Demographic and clinical data, including inpatient and outpatient opioid use were reviewed. Patients completed opioid use questionnaires at their first postoperative visit. Simple linear regression was employed to create a model for outpatient opioid use. Sixty-eight patients underwent MIRPE-C: 84% were male (mean age of 15.2 ± 1.7 years, and median Haller index 4.2[IQR:3.7-5.7]). Daily mean inpatient opioid requirement and daily opioid doses were 0.3 ± 0.2 OME/day/kg and 2 ± 1.2 opioid doses/day. At the first outpatient follow-up visit, patients reported using a median of five 5-mg oxycodone tablets [IQR:1.6-10] for 5 days [IQR:2-7] with 22% of patients needing an opioid refill. On linear regression, inpatient opioid use had a significant relationship with the number of outpatient doses taken, while patient factors were not associated with outpatient opioid use. A simple equation for predicting opioid need based on best fit (R2 = 0.211) was developed: #OUTPATIENT OPIOID TABLETS = 3 TABLETS + (0.82 x #INPATIENT OPIOID RECIEVED). The proposed outpatient opioid prescription model is simple to calculate and tailors the prescription to individual patient need. This model has the potential to provide effective pain control and avoid prescription refills, while minimizing over-prescription of opioids. Treatment study Level III.

An inherent defect of the sternum and ribs results in the formation of a funnel-shaped anterior chest wall. The gold standard of surgical correction is the minimally invasive Nuss procedure, which might cause severe pain and carries the risk of sensory disturbances and chronic discomfort. Integrating cryoanalgesia with standard multimodal analgesia improves the outcomes of this procedure. Based on histological results, it was hypothesised that the time of cryo-application can be reduced from the current standard period of two minutes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a one-minute application compared with the routine two-minute method in the same patient, considering the subjective perception of pain and sensory disturbances. A total of 33 patients were included in this prospective study. The results show that the assessment of pain severity and sensory disturbances did not differ significantly in terms of the time of cryo-application during first 14 days after the surgical procedure. The one-minute cryo-application time for intraoperative intercostal nerve cryoablation prior to the Nuss procedure seems to be as safe and effective as the routinely used two-minute application time in regards to pain severity, sensory disturbances, and the risk of chronic pain development. Intercostal nerve cryoanalgesia is an essential element of multimodal analgesia.

The Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum is associated with prolonged hospitalizations due to pain. We evaluated implementation of intercostal nerve cryoablation and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols on outcomes of Nuss procedures performed over six years at a single institution. This retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent Nuss procedure from 10/2017 to 09/2023. Patients received epidurals prior to 06/2019, cryoablation from 06/2019 to 07/2021, and ERAS with cryoablation and intraoperative methadone administration after 07/2021. We used multivariable linear regression to evaluate length of stay (LOS), inpatient morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), and discharge opioids. We assessed the balancing measures of operative time, postoperative pain scores, and complications. We identified 62 patients; 15 who received epidurals, 18 cryoablation, and 29 cryoablation with ERAS. Cryoablation was associated with a 62.3% (p < 0.001) decrease in length of stay, an 86.6% (p < 0.001) decrease in inpatient MMEs, and a 72.9% (p < 0.001) decrease in discharge opioids. Cryoablation was additionally associated with 24.5% (p = 0.02) longer operative times and 46.4% (p = 0.04) higher postoperative day one pain scores. Subsequent implementation of an ERAS protocol was associated with a further 82.8% (p = 0.04) decrease in discharge opioids and a 25.0% (p = 0.04) decrease in postoperative day one pain scores. Over six years of quality improvement efforts, we found the implementation of cryoablation and ERAS protocols to be associated with a significant decrease in length of stay and opioid exposures. Protocolized pain management and cryoablation may work synergistically to improve outcomes without compromising patient experience. Level III - Retrospective comparative study.

We therefore reviewed the experience of a Turkish and an Austrian center. An additional novelty characterizing both pediatric cohorts was the use of short bars. In a retrospective study, pediatric PE corrections involving 'short bars crossed' were analyzed for complications and intra-/postoperative outcomes. Cases with two or three bars were included, given that a horizontal third bar was placed whenever considered useful for upper-chest elevation. All bars were fitted with a single stabilizer near the surgical entry point. In the Austrian center, intercostal nerve cryoablation was used for pain management. Descriptive statistics are presented. Seventy-eight patients ≤18 years old were evaluable at the Turkish (n = 56) and Austrian (n = 22) centers. Total median values were 16.2 (IQR: 15.1-17.4) years for age and 4.60 (IQR: 3.50-6.11) for Haller index. Ten mild or moderate complications (12.8%) were observed, including just one revision requirement due to bar migration (1.28%). Intercostal nerve cryoablation (n = 13) was associated with longer surgical procedures at 150 (IQR: 137-171) versus 80 (IQR: 60-100) minutes but with shorter hospital stays, given an IQR of 3-4 days versus 4-5 days. 'Short bars crossed'-with a single stabilizer in a ventral position close to the surgical entry point-ensure a wide distribution of forces, protect against bar migration, are safe and effective, and offer stability at an age characterized by growth and physical activity.

The minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) is associated with significant postoperative pain and opioid use. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of intercostal nerve cryoablation (Cryo) on inpatient and post-hospital opioid prescription practices following MIPRE. A retrospective review at a single pediatric center was conducted of patients ≤21 years old who underwent MIRPE. Oral morphine equivalents (OME) of inpatient and discharge opioids were compared between Cryo and no-Cryo cohorts. 579 patients were identified (82.8% male, mean age 15.4 ± 2.0 years). Cryo was performed in 73.5% of patients. The total inpatient OME use was less in the Cryo group (0.89 ± 0.68 vs. 1.6 ± 0.5 OME/kg/day; p < 0.001). Patients who underwent Cryo were prescribed significantly less OME at discharge compared to the no-Cryo group (3.9 ± 1.7 vs. 10.0 ± 4.1 OME mg/kg, p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who required an opioid prescription refill (Cryo 12.4% vs. no-Cryo 11.5%, p = 0.884) or were readmitted (Cryo 5.3% vs. no-Cryo 4.6%, p = 0.833). Patients who underwent cryoablation during MIRPE were prescribed significantly less opioid at the time of discharge without increasing the need for opioid refills or hospital readmissions. Treatment study; Level III evidence.

Epidural analgesia is currently considered the gold standard in postoperative pain management for the minimally invasive Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum. Alternative analgesic strategies (eg, patient-controlled analgesia and paravertebral nerve block) fail in accomplishing adequate prolonged pain management. Furthermore, the continuous use of opioids, often prescribed in addition to all pain management strategies, comes with side effects. Intercostal nerve cryoablation seems a promising novel technique. Hence, the primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of intercostal nerve cryoablation on postoperative length of hospital stay compared with standard pain management of young pectus excavatum patients treated with the minimally invasive Nuss procedure. This study protocol is designed for a single centre, prospective, unblinded, randomised clinical trial. Intercostal nerve cryoablation will be compared with thoracic epidural analgesia in 50 young pectus excavatum patients (ie, 12-24 years of age) treated with the minimally invasive Nuss procedure. Block randomisation, including stratification based on age (12-16 years and 17-24 years) and sex, with an allocation ratio of 1:1 will be performed.Postoperative length of hospital stay will be recorded as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include (1) pain intensity, (2) operative time, (3) opioid usage, (4) complications, including neuropathic pain, (5) creatine kinase activity, (6) intensive care unit admissions, (7) readmissions, (8) postoperative mobility, (9) health-related quality of life, (10) days to return to work/school, (11) number of postoperative outpatient visits and (12) hospital costs. This protocol has been approved by the local Medical Ethics Review Committee, METC Zuyderland and Zuyd University of Applied Sciences. Participation in this study will be voluntary and informed consent will be obtained. Regardless of the outcome, the results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed international medical journal.

Intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and length of stay following surgical correction of pectus excavatum (SCOPE). Some patients have developed chest wall dermatological symptoms after INC that can be mistaken for metal allergy or infection. The purpose of this study is to report the symptoms, severity, incidence, and treatment of post-cryoablation dermatitis. A retrospective single institution review was performed for patients who underwent SCOPE with and without INC between June 2016 and March 2023 to assess for incidence of postoperative dermatological findings. Characteristics associated with these findings were evaluated. During study period, 383 patients underwent SCOPE, 165 (43.1%) without INC and 218 (56.9%) with. Twenty-three (10.6%) patients who received INC developed exanthems characteristic of post-cryoablation dermatitis with two distinct phenotypes identified. No patients who underwent SCOPE without INC developed similar manifestations. Early dermatitis, characterized by a painless, erythematous, and blanching rash across the anterior thorax, was observed in 16 patients, presenting on median postoperative day 6.0 [IQR 6.0-8.5], with median time to resolution of 23.0 [IQR 12-71.0] days after symptom onset. Late dermatitis, characterized by hyperpigmentation spanning the anterior thorax, was observed in 7 patients, presenting on median postoperative day 129.0 [IQR 84.5-240.0], with median time to resolution of 114.0 [IQR 48.0-314.3] days. This is the first report of dermatological manifestations following SCOPE with INC, a phenomenon of unknown etiology and no known long-term sequela. In our experience, it is self-resolving and lacks systemic symptoms suggesting observation alone is sufficient for resolution. IV.

Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum is a minimally invasive, but painful procedure. Recently, intercostal nerve cryoablation has been introduced as a pain management technique. In this cohort study, we compared the efficacy of multimodal pain management strategies in children undergoing a Nuss procedure. The effectiveness of intercostal nerve cryoablation combined with patient-controlled systemic opioid analgesia (PCA) was compared with continuous epidural analgesia (CEA) combined with PCA. The study was conducted between January 2019 and July 2022. Primary outcome was length of stay (LOS), and secondary outcomes were operation room time, postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and gabapentin use. Sixty-six consecutive patients were included, 33 patients in each group. The cryoablation group exhibited lower Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores on postoperative day 1 and 2 (p = 0.002, p = 0.001) and a shorter LOS (3 vs. 6 days (p < 0.001). Cryoablation resulted in less patients requiring opioids at discharge (30.3 vs. 97.0%; p < 0.001) and 1 week after surgery (6.1 vs. 45.4%; p < 0.001)). In the CEA group, gabapentin use was more prevalent (78.8 vs. 18.2%; p < 0.001) and the operation room time was shorter (119.4 vs. 135.0 minutes; p < .010). No neuropathic pain was reported. Intercostal nerve cryoablation is a superior analgesic method compared with CEA, with reduced LOS, opioid use, and NRS pain scores. The prophylactic use of gabapentin is redundant.

Thoracic surgery causes significant pain despite standard multimodal analgesia. Intraoperative cryoanalgesia may be a solution. The onset of the clinical effect of cryoanalgesia can take 12-36 h. The addition of a regional anaesthesia before the cryoanalgesia procedure can enable analgesic protection for the patient during this period. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the benefits of the erector spinae plane (ESP) block prior to Nuss surgery. The 'control' group consisted of 10 teenagers who underwent cryoablation together with intravenous multimodal analgesia according to the standard protocol. The 'intervention' group included 26 teenage patients who additionally received an erector spinae plane block before operation. Pain relief (p = 0.015), opioid use (p = 0.009), independent physical activity and rehabilitation (p = 0.020) were faster in the intervention group. No features of local anaesthetic drug toxicity or complications of the ESP block were observed. The bilateral ESP block together with intraoperative intercostal nerve cryoablation performed prior to Nuss correction of funnel chest were more effective in terms of pain control.

Minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) with intercostal nerve cryoablation (Cryo) decreases length of hospitalization and opioid use, but long-term recovery of sensation has been poorly described. The purpose of this study was to quantify long-term hypoesthesia and neuropathic pain after MIRPE with Cryo. A prospective cohort study was conducted single-institution of patients ≤21 years who presented for bar removal. Consented patients underwent chest wall sensory testing and completed neuropathic pain screening. Chest wall hypoesthesia to cold, soft touch, and pinprick were measured as the percent of the treated anterior chest wall surface area (TACWSA); neuropathic pain was evaluated by questionnaire. The study enrolled 47 patients; 87% male; median age 18.4 years. The median bar dwell time was 2.9 years. A median of 2 bars were placed; 80.9% were secured with pericostal sutures. At enrollment, 46.8% of patients had identifiable chest wall hypoesthesia. The mean percentage of TACWSA with hypoesthesia was 4.7 ± 9.3% (cold), 3.9 ± 7.7% (soft touch), and 5.9 ± 11.8% (pinprick). Hypoesthesia to cold was found in 0 dermatomes in 62%, 1 dermatome in 11%, 2 dermatomes in 17% and ≥3 dermatomes in 11%. T5 was the most common dermatome with hypoesthesia. Neuropathic symptoms were identified by 13% of patients; none required treatment. In long-term follow up after MIRPE with Cryo, 46.8% of patients experienced some chest wall hypoesthesia; the average TACWSA with hypoesthesia was 4-6%. Hypoesthesia was mostly limited to 1-2 dermatomes, most commonly T5. Chronic symptomatic neuropathic pain was rare. Level IV.

Intercostal nerve cryoablation is an increasingly adopted technique to decrease postoperative pain in patients undergoing surgical correction of pectus excavatum (SCOPE). Concerns regarding cryo-induced systemic hypothermia have been raised in pediatric patients; however, assessment of a cooled cryoprobe on body temperature has not been performed. We aimed to determine the energy flux from a maximally cooled cryoprobe and model the possible effects on a whole-body system. To directly measure energy flux, a maximally cooled cryoSPHERE probe (AtriCure, Inc, Mason, OH) was isolated in a well-mixed water bath at 37°C. Real-time temperatures were recorded. Three models were created to estimate intraoperative flux. Perioperative temperatures of 50 patients who received cryoablation during SCOPE were compared to 50 patients who did not receive cryoablation. Direct calorimetry measured average energy flux of the maximally cooled cryoprobe to be 28 J/s. Thermodynamic modeling demonstrated the following: 1) The highest possible cryoprobe flux is less than estimated basal metabolic rate (BMR) of the average teenager undergoing SCOPE and 2) Flux in a best model of human tissue energy transfer using available literature is far less than the effects of BMR and insensible losses. Clinically, there were no significant differences in the minimum intraoperative, end procedure or first postoperative body temperatures for patients who received cryoablation and those who did not. Cryoprobe flux is significantly fewer joules per second than BMR. Furthermore, in a clinical series there were no empiric differences in body temperature due to cryoablation employment, contradicting concerns regarding hypothermia secondary to cryoablation.

To examine differences in opioid use, length of stay, and adverse events after minimally invasive correction of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) with and without intercostal nerve cryoablation. Small studies show that intraoperative intercostal nerve cryoablation provides effective analgesia with no large-scale evaluations of this technique. The pediatric health information system database was used to perform a retrospective cohort study comparing patients undergoing MIRPE at children's hospitals before and after the initiation of cryoablation. The association of cryoablation use with inpatient opioid use was determined using quantile regression with robust standard errors. Difference in risk-adjusted length of stay between the cohorts was estimated using negative binomial regression. Odds of adverse events between the two cohorts were compared using logistic regression with a generalized estimating equation. A total of 5442 patients underwent MIRPE at 44 children's hospitals between 2016 and 2022 with 1592 patients treated after cryoablation was introduced at their hospital. Cryoablation use was associated with a median decrease of 80.8 (95% CI: 68.6-93.0) total oral morphine equivalents as well as a decrease in estimated median length of stay from 3.5 [3.2-3.9] days to 2.5 [2.2-2.9] days ( P value: 0.016). Cryoablation use was not significantly associated with an increase in any studied adverse events. Introduction of cryoablation for perioperative analgesia was associated with decreased inpatient opioid use and length of stay in a large sample with no change in adverse events. This novel modality for perioperative analgesia offers a promising alternative to traditional pain management in thoracic surgery.

The minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (PE) is a painful procedure that can result in long-term hospitalization and opioid use. To mitigate the length of stay and opioid consumption, many different analgesia strategies have been implemented. The aim of this study is to review the use and patient outcomes of intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) during PE repair reported in the literature. An unfunded literature search using PubMed identifying articles discussing INC during PE repair from 1946 to 1 July 2023 was performed. Articles were included if they discussed patient outcomes with INC use during PE repair. Articles were excluded if they were reviews/meta-analyses, editorials, or not available in English. Each article was reviewed for bias by analyzing the study methods, data analysis, patient selection, and patient follow-up. Articles comparing outcomes of INC were considered significant if p-value was <0.05. A total of 34 articles were included in this review that described INC use during pectus repair. Most supported a decreased hospital length of stay and opioid use with INC. Overall, INC was associated with fewer short-term and long-term complications. However, the researchers reported varied results of total hospital costs with the use of INC. The review was limited by a paucity of prospective studies and low number of patients who received INC. Despite this, the present data support INC as a safe and effective analgesic strategy during the repair of PE.

Pectus excavatum repair by the Nuss procedure results in severe postoperative pain. Regional blocks and intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) have emerged as potential strategies to manage analgesia. This study compares pain-related outcomes following these perioperative interventions. We reviewed charts of patients <18 y who underwent the Nuss procedure at Duke Children's Hospital from July 2018 to June 2022. Patients were divided into three groups by analgesic strategy: no block, regional catheters, or INC, representing the chronologic change in our practice. The primary outcome was total and daily in-hospital opioid utilization measured by oral morphine equivalents (OMEs). Secondary outcomes included average daily pain scores, length of stay, opioid refills after discharge, and complications. Twenty-one patients were included and analyzed: no block (n = 6), regional catheters (n = 7), and INC (n = 8). INC-treated patients required significantly lower total postoperative, in-hospital OMEs (64 ± 47 [mean ± standard deviation]) than those with no block (270 ± 217, P = 0.04) or those with regional catheters (273 ± 176, P = 0.03). INC was associated with longer average operative times (161 ± 36 min) than no block (105 ± 21 min, P = 0.005) or regional catheters (90 ± 11 min, P < 0.001). INC-treated patients had shorter hospital length of stays (median 68 h) than those with regional catheters (median 74 h, P = 0.006). INC was associated with longer operative times but decreased in-hospital OMEs when compared to bilateral regional block catheters and multimodal analgesia alone.

Background: Cryoanalgesia uses the application of cold temperatures to temporarily disrupt peripheral sensory nerve function for pain control. This review outlines the principles of cryoablation, clinical applications, and clinical data for its use in pediatric thoracic surgery. Methods: A comprehensive PubMed search was performed using the principal terms and combinations of cryoablation, cryoanalgesia, Nuss, Nuss repair, pectus, pectus excavatum, thoracic surgery, thoracotomy, and chest wall. Pediatric articles were reviewed and included if relevant. Adult articles were reviewed for supporting information as needed. Reference lists of included articles were reviewed for possible additional sources. Discussion: The scientific and clinical principles of cryoablation are outlined, followed by a focused review of current clinical application and outcome data. Conclusion: Postoperative pain is a major challenge following thoracic surgery. Cryoanalgesia is emerging as an adjunct in pediatric thoracic surgery, particularly for the Nuss procedure or minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum. It effectively controls pain, decreasing postoperative opioid use and hospital length of stay with few short-term complications. Although more long-term studies are needed, early evidence suggests there is reliable return of sensation to the chest wall and long-term neuropathic pain is rare.

Pain management for patients undergoing the Nuss procedure for treatment of pectus excavatum can be challenging. In an effort to improve pain management, our institution added bilateral single injection erector spinae plane (ESP) blocks to surgeon placed intercostal nerve cryoablation. We aimed to assess the efficacy of this practice change. Retrospective clinical data from a single academic medical center were evaluated. Due to an institutional change in clinical management, we were able to perform a before and after study. Twenty patients undergoing Nuss procedure who received bilateral ultrasound-guided single-shot T6 level ESP blocks and intercostal nerve cryoablation were compared with a historical control cohort of 20 patients who underwent Nuss procedure with intercostal nerve cryoablation alone. The primary outcome variables included postoperative pain scores, total hospital opioid use, and hospital length of stay. Median total hospital intravenous morphine milligram equivalents was lower for the ESP group than for the control group (0.60 (IQR 0.35-0.88) vs 1.15 mg/kg (IQR 0.74-1.68), p<0.01). There was no difference in postoperative pain scores between the two groups. Mean hospital length of stay was 2.45 (SD 0.69) days for the control group and 1.95 (SD 0.69) days for the ESP group (p=0.03). No adverse events related to block placement were identified. In a single-center academic practice, the addition of bilateral single injection ESP blocks at T6 to surgeon performed cryoablation reduced opioid consumption without a change in subjectively reported pain scores. The results from this pilot study can provide effect size estimates to guide the design of future randomized trials.

Pain control after minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) can be challenging, especially in adult patients undergoing surgical repair. This study reviewed different analgesic modalities used over ≥10 years after pectus repair. A retrospective analysis was performed of adult patients (≥18 years) who underwent uncomplicated primary MIRPE at a single institution from October 2010 to December 2021. Patients were classified by analgesic modality used: epidural, elastomeric continuous infusion subcutaneous catheters (SC-Caths), and intercostal nerve cryoablation. Comparisons among the 3 groups were performed. In total, 729 patients were included (mean age, 30.9 ±10.3 years; 67% male; mean Haller index, 4.9 ±3.0). Patients in the cryoablation group required significantly lower doses of morphine equivalents (P < .001) and had overall the shortest hospital stay (mean, 1.9 ±1.5 days; P < .001) with <17% staying >2 days (vs epidural at 94% and SC-Cath at 48%; P < .001). The cryoablation group had a lower incidence of ileus and constipation (P < .001) but a higher incidence of pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis (P = .024). Mean pain scores among groups were minor (<3), and differences were insignificant. The use of cryoablation in conjunction with enhanced recovery pathways provided significant benefit to our patients undergoing MIRPE compared with previous analgesic modalities. These benefits included a decrease in length of hospital stay, a reduction of in-hospital opioid use, and a lower incidence of opioid-related complications associated with constipation and ileus. Further studies to assess additional potential benefits with long-term follow-up after discharge are warranted.

The Nuss repair for pectus excavatum is associated with significant postoperative pain. Our institution developed protocols to standardize pain management for pectus excavatum patients in the immediate postoperative period. We present our experience with protocol implementation and patient outcomes. We standardized regional anesthesia with a 0.25% bupivacaine incisional soaker catheter (post-implementation 1, PI1) before transitioning to intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) (post-implementation 2, PI2). Patient outcomes were tracked using statistical process control charts in AdaptX™ OR Advisor and run charts in Tableau. Chi-squared tests assessed demographic differences between cohorts. 244 patients were included: 78 pre-implementation, 108 PI1, and 58 PI2. Average age was 15.9-16.5 years. Patients were majority male, non-Hispanic white, and English speaking. Hospital length of stay decreased 4.1-2.4 days. INC increased surgery time (99-125 min) but decreased PACU time (112-78 min). Maximum pain scores improved in PACU (7.7-6.0) and 0-24 h postoperatively (8.3-6.8) but were not different 24-48 h postoperatively (5.4-5.8). Average opioid dosing decreased 0-48 h from 1.9 to 0.8 mg/kg morphine milliequivalents and was associated with reduction in post-operative nausea and constipation. There were no 30-day readmissions. An institution-wide pain management protocol using INC for pectus excavatum patients was implemented. Intercostal nerve cryoablation was found to be superior to bupivacaine incisional soaker catheters and reduced hospital length of stay, immediate postoperative pain scores, morphine milliequivalent opioid dosing, postoperative nausea, and constipation.

We implemented and evaluated an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) protocol for Nuss procedures consisting of patient education, bowel management, pre/post-operative transitional pain service involvement, serratus anterior plane blocks and intercostal nerve cryoablation. A 5-point ERAS protocol was implemented using multiple plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. Data was collected prospectively for patients in the full ERAS protocol and retrospectively for previous patients. The primary outcome was length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes were opioid consumption, pain scores, protocol compliance and patient satisfaction. The impact of PDSA cycles and the ERAS protocol was quantified using statistical process control charts and Mann Whitney U test. A total of 53 patients were identified, 13 within the ERAS protocol and 40 prior to introduction. There was no difference in age, sex, or Haller index between the two cohorts. The median LOS was decreased by 3 days in the ERAS cohort (P = 0.00001). There was decreased opioid consumption on post-operative day 1 (1.47 vs 1.96 MME/kg, p = 0.009) and overall (3.12 vs 6.35 MME/kg, p = 0.0042) in the ERAS cohort. Median pain scores did not differ between cohorts. ERAS bundle element compliance was: education 92%, bowel management 100%, transitional pain involvement 100%, serratus block 100% and cryoablation 100%. The 1-month survey revealed that 92% of patients were satisfied with their experience. Our results demonstrate significant reduction in LOS and a trend to decreasing opioid consumption in hospital following ERAS protocol implementation and support the further application of ERAS protocols in pediatrics.

A total of 98 patients underwent CRE: 68 CRE without cryo, 22 CRE + Cryo, and 8 combined MIRPE + CRE + Cryo. Ninety percent of patients underwent bioabsorbable rib plating. Patients were predominantly female (79%, 73%, 50% respectively) with median ages 17.6, 16.9, and 14.2 years respectively. CRE + Cryo patients used significantly less opioids in hospital (0.6 OME/kg [0.1,1.2]) compared to CRE without cryo (1.0 OME/kg [0.6,2.1]), p < 0.05. The median length of stay (LOS) in CRE + Cryo was 1 day [1,2] compared to 2 days in CRE without cryo [1,2], p = 0.09. MIRPE + CRE + Cryo patients used 0.6 OME/kg [0.2,8.0] with a 2 day [1,5.5] LOS. Ninety-one percent of Cryo patients had cryoablation of T9 and/or T10 intercostal nerves, with no documented abdominal wall laxity at median follow-up of 16 days. Cryo was applied extra-thoracically in CRE + cryo without thoracoscopy or lung isolation, while MIRPE + CRE + Cryo used a combination extra-/intra-thoracic cryoablation in with thoracoscopy. Intercostal nerve cryoablation reduces opioid use and LOS in patients undergoing cartilaginous rib excision for slipping rib syndrome. Cryotherapy to as low as T10 did not result in abdominal wall laxity and can be applied extra-thoracically without the need for thoracoscopy. Ongoing prospective studies are required to assess the long-term outcomes. III.

Pectus excavatum is the most common congenital chest wall abnormality, with the Nuss procedure being the most commonly performed repair. Pain control is the predominant factor in the postoperative treatment of these patients. This study aims to compare the cost and outcomes of intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) and thoracic epidural (TE) in patients undergoing the Nuss procedure. A retrospective chart review was conducted at our institution for all patients who underwent the Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum from 2002 to 2020. Patients were stratified by pain management strategy, INC vs. TE. Chi-square and Fisher's exact were used to compare categorical variables. Wilcoxon tests were used to evaluate continuous variables and costs. A total of 158 patients were identified. Of these, 80.4% (N = 127) were treated with epidural, while 19.6% (N = 31) were treated with intercostal nerve cryoablation. The INC group had lower rates of PCA use (35.5% vs. 93.7%, p < 0.001), lower total morphine milligram equivalent requirement (27.0 vs. 290.8, p < 0.001), and shorter length of stay (3.2 days vs. 5.3 days, p < 0.001) compared to the TE group. INC was also associated with longer operative times (153.0 min vs. 89.0 min, p < 0.001). The total hospitalization cost for the INC group was higher compared to the TE group ($24,742.5 vs $21,621.9, p = 0.001). In patients undergoing the Nuss procedure, compared to thoracic epidural, INC was associated with lower opioid use and shorter length of stay but at the cost of longer operative time and increased hospitalization cost. Treatment Study, Level III.

Intercostal nerve cryoablation reduces postoperative pain in adults undergoing thoracotomy and children undergoing pectus excavatum repair. We hypothesize that cryoablation is associated with decreased post-thoracotomy pain and opioid use in pediatric oncology patients. A single-center retrospective cohort study was performed for oncology patients who underwent thoracotomy from January 1, 2017 to May 31, 2021. Outcomes included postoperative opioid use measured in morphine milligram equivalents per kilogram (MME/kg), pain scores (scale 0-10), and opioid prescription at discharge. Univariable analysis compared patients who received cryoablation to patients who did not receive cryoablation. Multivariable regression analysis controlling for age and prior thoracotomy evaluated associations between cryoablation and postoperative pain. Overall, 32 patients (19 males:13 females) underwent thoracotomy with 16 who underwent >1 thoracotomy resulting in 53 thoracotomies included for analysis. Cryoablation was used in 14 of 53 (26.4%) thoracotomies. Throughout the postoperative hospitalization, patients receiving cryoablation during thoracotomy consumed less opioids compared to patients who did not receive cryoablation (median 0.38 MME/kg, interquartile range [IQR] 0.20-1.15 versus median 1.47 MME/kg, IQR 0.71-4.02, P < 0.01). Maximum pain scores were lower in cryoablation patients (median 6, IQR 5-8) than noncryoablation patients (median 8, IQR 6-10), with a significant difference observed on postoperative day 4 (P = 0.01). Cryoablation patients were also less frequently prescribed opioids at discharge (21.4% versus 58.97%, P = 0.02). Multivariable regression demonstrated that cryoablation was associated with 2.59 MME/kg less opioid use (95% confidence interval -4.56 to -0.63) and decreased likelihood of opioid prescription at discharge (adjusted odds ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.67). Cryoablation is significantly associated with decreased post-thoracotomy pain and opioid use in pediatric cancer patients and should be considered in postoperative pain regimens.

Introduction: Cryoablation of intercostal nerves is performed for pain control after minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE). Cryoablation affects both sensory and motor neurons, resulting in temporary anesthesia to the chest wall and loss of intercostal motor function. The study objective is to determine the effect of cryoablation on incentive spirometry (IS) volumes, as a measure of pulmonary function, after MIRPE. Materials and Methods: A single-institution retrospective review of pediatric patients undergoing MIRPE was performed. All patients received a multimodal regimen (MMR) of analgesics postoperatively. Three groups were compared-cryoablation (CRYO), elastomeric pain pump (EPP), and MMR alone. The primary outcomes were postoperative IS volumes and IS volumes as a ratio of preoperative forced vital capacity (FVC). Secondary outcomes included pain scores, opioid use, length of stay (LOS), and infectious complications. Results: MIRPE was performed in 115 patients: 50 CRYO, 50 EPP, and 15 MMR alone. Groups were similar for demographics and pectus excavatum severity. Postoperative spirometry measurements were similar across groups: IS (CRYO 750 mL [500,961] versus EPP 750 mL [590,1019] versus MMR 696 mL [500,1037], P = .77); IS/FVC (CRYO 0.19 [0.14,0.26] versus EPP 0.20 [0.16,0.26] versus MMR 0.16 [0.15,0.24], P = .69). Although pain scores were also similar across groups, CRYO patients used less opioid (P < .05) and had shorter LOS (P < .05). Postoperative pneumonia was rare and similar across groups (P = 1.00). Conclusion: Intercostal nerve cryoablation during MIRPE does not adversely affect postoperative IS volumes or increase pneumonia rate, despite the temporary loss of motor innervation to intercostal muscles. Cryoablation provides effective pain control with less opioid use.

Intraoperative intercostal nerve cryoablation has emerged as a promising modality for postoperative analgesia following Surgical Correction of Pectus Excavatum (SCOPE). Most centers use two-minute cryoablation per level, although data from histologic and adult studies suggest the effectiveness of one-minute freezes. We aimed to describe our center's experience with one minute per level cryoablation. A retrospective single institution review of patients undergoing SCOPE was performed to compare patients pre- and post-intercostal nerve cryoablation implementation. Cryoablation was performed as one minute for each of the thoracic intercostal nerves T3-T7. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to compare the outcomes and cost between pre- and post-implementation groups. During the study period, 198 patients underwent SCOPE with one Nuss bar, receiving either intraoperative intercostal nerve cryoablation (Cryo, n = 100) or preoperative thoracic paravertebral catheters (NoCryo, n = 98). Surgical time was on average 9 min longer for the Cryo group (p<0.01). Median length of stay for the Cryo group was 3 days shorter compared to the NoCryo group (p<0.01). The Cryo group had a 19-fold and 5.6-fold reduction in average inpatient and total postoperative opioid usage, respectively (p<0.01). Total hospital costs were significantly lower in the Cryo group (p<0.01). Overall complication rate was not statistically significant different between the two groups. Intraoperative one minute per level cryoablation is a potent approach to postoperative analgesia for SCOPE patients that led to a shorter hospital length of stay, lower hospital costs, and decreased opioid use compared to conventional analgesia at our institution. Pediatric surgeons performing correction of chest wall deformities should consider offering this technique.

Intercostal nerve cryoablation with the Nuss procedure has been shown to decrease opioid requirements and hospital length of stay; however, few studies have evaluated the impact on complications and hospital costs. A retrospective cohort study was performed for all Nuss procedures at our institution from 2016 through 2020. Outcomes were compared across 4 pain modalities: cryoablation with standardized pain regimen (n = 98), patient-controlled analgesia (PCA; n = 96), epidural (n = 36), and PCA with peripheral nerve block (PNB; n = 35). Outcomes collected included length of stay, opioid use, variable direct costs, and postoperative complications. Univariate and multivariate hierarchical regression analysis was used to compare outcomes between the pain modalities. Cryoablation was associated with increased total hospital cost compared with PCA (cryoablation, $11 145; PCA, $8975; P < .01), but not when compared with epidural ($9678) or PCA with PNB ($10 303). The primary driver for increased costs was operating room supplies (PCA, $2741; epidural, $2767; PCA with PNB, $3157; and cryoablation, $5938; P < .01). With multivariate analysis, cryoablation was associated with decreased length of stay (-1.94; 95% CI, -2.30 to -1.57), opioid use during hospitalization (-3.54; 95% CI, -4.81 to -2.28), and urinary retention (0.13; 95% CI, 0.05-0.35). Cryoablation significantly reduces opioid requirements and length of stay relative to alternative modalities, but it was associated with an increase in total hospital costs relative to PCA, but not epidural or PCA with PNB. Cryoablation was not associated with allodynia or slipped bars requiring reoperation.

The use of intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) is becoming increasingly common in patients undergoing pectus repair. This study sought to evaluate the use of INC compared to traditional use of thoracic epidural (TE) in patients undergoing the modified Ravitch procedure. A retrospective review of 37 patients undergoing the modified Ravitch repair with either INC or TE from March 2009 to July 2021 was conducted. The operations were performed by four surgeons who worked together at four different hospitals and have the same standardized practice. The primary outcome measure was hospital length of stay (LOS). Secondary variables included surgical time, total operating room time, operating room time cost, total hospital cost, inpatient opioid use, long term opioid use after discharge, and post-operative complications. LOS decreased to 2.8 days in the INC group compared to 6 days in the TE group (p<0.0001). Surgical time and total OR time was increased in the INC group. The INC group experienced significantly lower hospital costs (p<0.01). Total hospital opioid administration was significantly lower in INC group, and there was a significant decrease in long term opioid use in the INC group (p<0.0001). INC is a newer modality that decreases LOS, controls pain, and results in overall cost savings for patients undergoing the modified Ravitch procedure. We recommend that INC be included in the current practice for postoperative pain control in pectus disorder patients undergoing the modified Ravitch procedure.

Minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) involves placement of a transthoracic, retrosternal support bar under thoracoscopic guidance. Despite its minimally invasive technical approach, postoperative pain is a significant morbidity that often results in increased length of stay. Multi-modal pain control strategies have been used in the past with limited success. Recently, the use of intraoperative intercostal nerve cryoablation (CA) has been added. In the present study, we aim to evaluate the effects of CA on postoperative pain control, opioid requirements, and perioperative outcomes. A single-center, retrospective chart review of all patients (less than 18 years old) who underwent MIRPE from 2009 to 2020 was performed. CA was started in June 2018. Data collection included demographics, preoperative characteristics, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcomes. We hypothesized that CA would be associated with improved pain scores, lower doses of total inpatient opioid requirement, and shorter length of stay (LOS). One hundred sixty-one patients met inclusion criteria: 75 underwent intraoperative CA and 86 underwent MIRPE without CA (NCA group). CA significantly decreased median LOS from 4 days in NCA to 2 days; the use of CA was the only significant predictor of LOS on linear regression. CA was also associated with decreased total PCA, intravenous opioid, and oral opioid dosages. There was no difference in inpatient pain scores and a slight increase in mean procedure time. However, CA was associated with significantly decreased postoperative complications. The use of cryoablation during MIRPE significantly decreases LOS, perioperative opioid requirements, and postoperative complications, with a minimal increase in operative time. Cryoablation is an effective pain control modality in the surgical management of chest wall deformities in children.

We report the findings of a three-year prospective observational study elucidating long-term symptoms and complications of patients who underwent minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair with intercostal nerve cryoablation with specific attention to postoperative pain control associated with the cryoablation technique. Surveys were administered to patients who underwent bar placement for pectus excavatum with intercostal nerve cryoablation from 2017 to 2021 regarding pain scores, pain medication usage, and limitations to activity beginning on the day of surgery, on the day of discharge, and at two-week and three-month follow-up. Of 110 patients, forty-eight (44%) completed the discharge survey; sharp pain and pressure on the first postoperative night were the most described pain characteristics, most frequently in the middle of the chest. On follow-up, 55% of patients reported tolerable residual pain at two weeks and 41% at three months, with 25% requiring intermittent pain medication at three months. There were three readmissions for inadequate pain control and 110 calls to the surgery clinic by three-month follow-up, most commonly for persistent pain and frequent popping sensation with movement. Although cryoablation is an excellent pain control modality, these data suggest that patients underreport functional symptoms and experience more frequent discomfort and alteration of daily living activities.

Intercostal nerve cryoablation (cryoanalgesia) is increasingly used for pain control in minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) by Nuss procedure. Cryoanalgesia may lower core body temperature and increase the risk of postoperative infectious complications. We investigated cryoanalgesia effects on infectious complications following MIRPE. We performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing MIRPE at our institution. Patients treated via multimodal analgesia with cryoanalgesia (Cryo) were compared to patients treated via multimodal analgesia +/- elastomeric pain pumps (Non-cryo). Core body and intraoperative minimum/maximum temperatures were recorded. Primary outcomes were wound infection and pneumonia; secondary outcome was length of stay (LOS). Fisher's Exact and Mann-Whitney U tests compared proportions and medians respectively, p-value ≤ 0.05 being significant. 80 patients were included, 35(43.7%) Cryo and 45(56.3%) Non-cryo. There were no significant differences in median [IQR] for age(15[13.3,16.0];p =0.86), number of bars inserted (2[1,2];p = 0.57), or operative time(123.5[98.3, 148.8]; p = 0.11) between the two groups. We found no significant differences in median [IQR] minimum temperature (35.4°C [35.0,35.8];p = 0.76), median change in intraoperative temperature (-0.13°C [-0.44,0.00];p = 0.94) or median recovery temperature (-1.10°C [-1.56,-0.65]; p = 0.59) between Cryo and Non-cryo. PACU temperature was significantly lower in the Cryo group, 36.4°C [36.2,36.6] p = 0.04. There were no postoperative wound infections in either group and no significant difference in incidence of postoperative pneumonia (8.57% versus 2.22%,p =  0.31) or median[IQR] for LOS (4[3,4];p = 0.57), between Cryo and Non-cryo patients. Although cryoanalgesia for MIRPE resulted in lower core body temperature, there appears to be no significant difference between Cryo and Non-Cryo patients for LOS or infectious complications.

The Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum has historically been associated with significant postoperative pain, which has been the major factor contributing to hospital length of stay (LOS). A single-institution, prospective study of 40 consecutive patients undergoing Nuss bar placement for pectus excavatum between November 2019 and January 2021 was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a multimodality pain management protocol. All patients received T3-T8 intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC), T3-T8 bupivacaine intercostal nerve blocks, Exparel at the skin incisions, and management with a perioperative analgesia regimen that minimized narcotic usage. The primary outcome was LOS. Secondary outcomes included opioid use, pain scores, and time to sensory recovery. 37/40 patients (92.5%) were discharged home on postoperative day (POD) 1, and 3/40 (7.5%) were discharged on POD 2 (mean LOS = 1.1 days). The median average postoperative pain score was 2/10. After eliminating IVPCA from our protocol, total oral morphine equivalent (OME) decreased by 73% (55.5 mg to 15 mg) with no change in pain scores or discharge timing. INC combined with bupivacaine intercostal nerve blocks and a pre- and post-hospital analgesia protocol facilitated discharge one day after the Nuss procedure, achieved excellent pain control, and eliminated the need for intravenous opioids.

Intercostal Nerve Cryoablation (INC) has significantly improved pain control following the Nuss repair of pectus excavatum (PE). This study sought to evaluate patients undergoing the Nuss repair with INC compared to the Nuss repair with an ERAS protocol, INC, and intercostal nerve blocks (INB). In June 2020, a new protocol was implemented involving surgery, anesthesia, nursing, physical therapy, and child life with the goal of safe same day discharge for patients undergoing the Nuss repair. They were compared to a control group who underwent the Nuss repair with INC alone in 2017-2019. The primary outcome measure was hospital length of stay (LOS) in hours, secondary outcomes were number of patients discharged on postoperative day (POD) 0, and returns to the emergency department (ED), urgent care (UC), and operating room (OR). The characteristics between the groups were the same (Table 1). The mean LOS was 11.8 h in the INB group versus 58.2 h in the INC group, p < 0.01. 10 of 15 patients in the INB group went home on POD 0 (average of 5.5 h postop), versus 0 patients in the INC only group, p < 0.01. Five patients in the INB stayed overnight. Two patients stayed owing to anxiety, one owing to urinary retention, one owing to nausea, and one owing to drowsiness. None stayed for pain control. Four patients in the INC group returned to the ED for pain control, versus 0 in the INB group, and 1 patient in the INB returned to UC for constipation. The majority of patients undergoing the Nuss repair of PE with a multidisciplinary regimen of pre and postoperative nursing education, precise intraoperative anesthesia care, performance of direct vision INB and INC, as well as careful surgery can go home on the day of surgery without adverse outcomes or unanticipated returns to the hospital.

The Nuss procedure is the most common and preferred operative correction of pectus excavatum. Surgeon preference and patient factors can result in variations in Nuss procedure technique. We hypothesize that certain techniques are associated with increased risk of complications. We performed a single-center retrospective review of Nuss operations from 2016 to 2020. Variations in intraoperative techniques included sternal elevator (SE) use, number of bars placed, and usage of bilateral stabilizing sutures. Patient demographics, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes were reported as median with interquartile ranges or percentages. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined with Wilcoxon's rank-sum and chi-square tests. Multivariate analysis was performed to control for introduction of intercostal nerve cryoablation and surgeon volume, and reported as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Two hundred and sixty-five patients were identified. Patients repaired with two bars were older with a larger Haller index (HI). Patient demographics were not significantly different for SE or stabilizing suture use. Placement of two bars was associated with significantly increased risk of readmission. Similarly, SE use was associated with increased risk of pleural effusion and readmission. Finally, the use of bilateral stabilizing sutures resulted in less frequent slipped bars without statistical significance. Older patients with a larger HI were more likely to need two bars placed to repair pectus excavatum. Placement of multiple bars and SE use are associated with significantly higher odds of certain complications.

The results of intercostal nerve cryoablation during correction of pectus excavatum in 10 older patients were analyzed. Postoperative outcomes were followed-up over a period of 4 - 12 months. There were no perioperative surgical complications. In 1 case, moderate pain syndrome persisted for 3 months after surgery (mean VAS score 2±1.3). In 9 months, mean VAS score was 0.6±0.6 in a month after surgery. Intercostal nerve cryoablation in correction of pectus excavatum in adults may be an alternative to the current methods of regional analgesia. Further research is requried to achieve objective information.

The use of intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) has been an effective modality for treating pain in patients undergoing pectus excavatum (PE) repair. This study sought to evaluate if PE patients undergoing Nuss procedures with INC and intercostal nerve block (INB) could safely be discharged the same day of surgery. A prospective study with IRB approval of 15 consecutive patients undergoing PE Nuss repair with INC, INB, and an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol was conducted. The primary outcome measure was hospital length of stay (LOS) in hours. Secondary variables included same day discharge, postoperative complications, emergency department (ED) visits, urgent care (UC) visits, opioid use, and return to the operating room (OR). LOS averaged 11.9 h amongst 15 patients. Ten patients (66.7%) went home on postoperative day (POD) 0, and the rest went home on POD 1. No patients stayed in the hospital due to pain. Reasons for failure to discharge included urinary retention, drowsiness, vomiting, and anxiety, but not pain. No patients were readmitted to the ED. One patient visited UC for constipation. One patient had bar migration requiring return to the OR for revision. Ten (66.7%) patients did not use opioids after discharge. Same day discharge is feasible and safe in PE patients undergoing Nuss procedure with INC and INB. INC with INB can adequately control pain without significant complications. Same day discharge can be safely considered for PE patients undergoing Nuss procedure with INC with INB. Prognosis study LEVEL-OF-EVIDENCE RATING: Level II.

Patients who received cryoablation were compared to those that received traditional pain control (patient-controlled analgesia or epidural). Outcome variables included postoperative opioid usage (milligram morphine equivalents, MME), length of stay (LOS), and hospital cost. Thirty-five of 73 patients studied (48%) received intercostal nerve cryoablation. LOS (1.0 vs 4.0 days, p < 0.01) and total hospital cost ($21,924 versus $23,694, p = 0.04) were decreased in the cryoablation cohort, despite longer operative time (152 vs 74 min, p < 0.01). Cryoablation was associated with decreased opioid usage (15.0 versus 148.6 MME, p < 0.01) during the 24 h following surgery and this persisted over the entire postoperative period, including discharge opioid prescription (112.5 vs 300.0 MME, p < 0.01). Bilateral intercostal nerve cryoablation is associated with decreased postoperative opioid usage and decreased resource utilization in pediatric patients undergoing a minimally invasive Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum. Retrospective comparative study, level III.

Minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair via the Nuss procedure is associated with significant postoperative pain that is considered as the dominant factor affecting the duration of hospitalization. Postoperative pain after the Nuss procedures is commonly controlled by thoracic epidural analgesia. Recently, intercostal nerve cryoablation has been proposed as an alternative method with long-acting pain control and shortened hospitalization. The subsequent objective was to systematically review the outcomes of intercostal nerve cryoablation in comparison to thoracic epidural after the Nuss procedure. Six scientific databases were searched. Data concerning the length of hospital stay, operative time and postoperative opioid usage were extracted. If possible, data were submitted to meta-analysis using the mean of differences, random-effects model with inverse variance method and I2 test for heterogeneity. Four observational and 1 randomized study were included, enrolling a total of 196 patients. Meta-analyses demonstrated a significantly shortened length of hospital stay [mean difference -2.91 days; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.68 to -2.15; P < 0.001] and increased operative time (mean difference 40.91 min; 95% CI 14.42-67.40; P < 0.001) for cryoablation. Both analyses demonstrated significant heterogeneity (both I2 = 91%; P < 0.001). Qualitative analysis demonstrated the amount of postoperative opioid usage to be significantly lower for cryoablation in 3 out of 4 reporting studies. Intercostal nerve cryoablation during the Nuss procedure may be an attractive alternative to thoracic epidural analgesia, resulting in shortened hospitalization. However, given the low quality and heterogeneity of studies, more randomized controlled trials are needed.

Recent publications report early discharge and low opioid requirements after minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair treated with bilateral intercostal nerve cryoablation. Our aim is to report our initial experience with this technique. Retrospective analysis of medical records of patients undergoing bilateral thoracoscopic cryoanalgesia during minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair within our institution from September 2018 to March 2019. A cryoprobe was applied at -70 ºC for 2 minutes each from the 3rd to the 7th intercostal nerves bilaterally under thoracoscopic control. Postoperative pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Twenty-one patients were included. Ninety percent were male, the mean age being 15.2 ± 4.29 years, and the mean weight being 53.6 ± 15.33 kg. The average Haller index was 5.1 ± 2.97, and the mean repair index was 37.6 ± 13.77%. The mean number of implants introduced was 2.55 ± 0.74. The mean duration of cryoanalgesia was 39.9 ± 21.1. No patients received epidural anesthesia. Mean postoperative stay was 1.64 ± 0.73 days. Seventy-one percent of the patients required 1 dose of opioids at the most for postoperative pain control. According to the VAS, the average pain score on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, and 21 was 2.55, 2.01, 0.5, and 0.06, respectively. Bilateral thoracoscopic cryoanalgesia during minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair leads to early discharge and good postoperative pain control in all cases. Cryoanalgesia has become our treatment of choice for pain control in the thoracoscopic repair of pectus excavatum.

Intercostal nerve cryoblation during the Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum decreases pain, opiate requirement, and hospital length of stay (LOS) compared to thoracic epidural analgesia. However, long-term complications of cryoablation, including neuropathic pain development, are not well studied. We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective review of patients following intercostal nerve cryoablation during Nuss bar insertion (11/2015-7/2018). Patients completed the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs, a validated questionnaire for detecting neuropathic symptoms. Primary outcome was neuropathic pain development. Secondary outcomes included duration of chest numbness and LOS. T test was performed; p < 0.05 is significant. 43 patients underwent intercostal cryoablation during the Nuss procedure. Ages at repair ranged 11-47 years (median 16). Patients were grouped by age: ≤ 21 years (30 patients) or older (13 patients). Mean LOS was shorter for the younger group, 2.0 versus 3.9 days (p = 0.03). No patients in the younger group, and three in the older, experienced neuropathic pain. Mean time to numbness resolution was shorter for the younger group, 3.4 versus 10.8 months (p = 0.003). In pediatric patients, intercostal cryoablation provides effective analgesia following the Nuss procedure with minimal risk of post-operative neuropathic pain. Adult patients are at greater risk of experiencing neuropathic pain and prolonged numbness.

Minimally-invasive repair of pectus excavatum by the Nuss procedure is associated with significant postoperative pain, prolonged hospital stay, and high opiate requirement. We hypothesized that intercostal nerve cryoablation during the Nuss procedure reduces hospital length of stay (LOS) compared to thoracic epidural analgesia. This randomized clinical trial evaluated 20 consecutive patients undergoing the Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum between May 2016 and March 2018. Patients were randomized evenly via closed-envelope method to receive either cryoanalgesia or thoracic epidural analgesia. Patients and physicians were blinded to study arm until immediately preoperatively. Single institution, UCSF-Benioff Children's Hospital. 20 consecutive patients were recruited from those scheduled for the Nuss procedure. Exclusion criteria were age < 13 years, chest wall anomaly other than pectus excavatum, previous repair or other thoracic surgery, and chronic use of pain medications. Primary outcome was postoperative LOS. Secondary outcomes included total operative time, total/daily opioid requirement, inpatient/outpatient pain score, and complications. Primary outcome data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U-test for nonparametric continuous variables. Other continuous variables were analyzed by two-tailed t-test, while categorical data were compared via Chi-squared test, with alpha = 0.05 for significance. 20 patients were randomized to receive either cryoablation (n = 10) or thoracic epidural (n = 10). Mean operating room time was 46.5 min longer in the cryoanalgesia group (p = 0.0001). Median LOS decreased by 2 days in patients undergoing cryoablation, to 3 days from 5 days (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.0001). Cryoablation patients required significantly less inpatient opioid analgesia with a mean decrease of 416 mg oral morphine equivalent per patient (p = 0.0001), requiring 52%-82% fewer milligrams on postoperative days 1-3 (p < 0.01 each day). There was no difference in mean pain score between the groups at any point postoperatively, up to one year, and no increased incidence of neuropathic pain in the cryoablation group. No complications were noted in the cryoablation group; among patients with epidurals, one patient experienced a symptomatic pneumothorax and another had urinary retention. Intercostal nerve cryoablation during the Nuss procedure decreases hospital length of stay and opiate requirement versus thoracic epidural analgesia, while offering equivalent pain control. Treatment study. Level I.

This study aimed to evaluate postoperative outcomes after minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (Nuss procedure) using video-assisted intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) compared to thoracic epidural (TE). We performed a single center retrospective review of pediatric patients who underwent Nuss procedure with INC (n = 19) or TE (n = 13) from April 2015 to August 2017. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative characteristics were collected. The primary outcome was length of stay (LOS) and secondary outcomes were intravenous and oral opioid use, pain scores, and complications. Opioids were converted to oral morphine milligram equivalents per kilogram (oral morphine equivalent [OME]/kg). Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous and chi-squared analysis for categorical variables. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics, except Haller Index (INC: median [interquartile range] 4.3 [3.6-4.9]; TE: 3.2 [2.8-4.0]; P = 0.03). LOS was shorter with INC (INC: 3 [3-4] days; TE: 6 [5-7] days; P < 0.001). Opioid use was higher intraoperatively (INC: 1.08 [0.87-1.37] OME/kg; TE: 0.46 [0.37-0.67] OME/kg; P = 0.002) and unchanged postoperatively (INC: 1.78 [1.26-3.77] OME/kg; TE: 1.82 [1.05-3.37] OME/kg; P = 0.80), and prescription doses were lower at discharge in INC (INC: 30 [30-40] doses; TE: 42 [40-60] doses; P = 0.005). There was no significant difference in postoperative complications (INC: 42.1%; TE: 53.9%; P = 0.51). INC during Nuss procedure reduced LOS, shifting postoperative opioid use earlier during admission. This may reflect the need for improved early pain control until INC takes effect. Prospective evaluation after INC is needed to characterize long-term pain medication requirements.

The Nuss procedure for surgical correction of pectus excavatum often causes severe postoperative pain. Cryoanalgesia of intercostal nerves is an alternative modality for pain control. We describe our modification of the cryoICE™ probe that allows for nerve ablation through the ipsilateral chest along with early results utilizing this technique. To allow for ipsilateral nerve ablation, a 20-French chest tube was cut and secured to the cryoICE probe, thus providing insulation for the malleable end of the probe. A 3-year retrospective review of patients undergoing Nuss repair at our institution was performed. Patients who received cryoanalgesia (cryo, n = 6) were compared with a historical control cohort who did not receive cryoanalgesia (nocryo, n = 13) during Nuss repair. Hospital length of stay, postoperative narcotic requirement (PNR), and highest postoperative pain score were collected. Both cohorts were similar regarding age, BMI, and pectus index. The cryo group had a significantly less PNR (6.4 versus 17.9 doses, P = .05) and was discharged on average >1 day earlier than nocryo patients (3.7 versus 2.2 days, P = .01). No complications occurred in either group. Our technique modification simplifies previously described approaches to intercostal nerve cryoablation. Patients undergoing this adjunct benefit with less PNR and a faster discharge time.

Multimodal pain management strategies are used for analgesia following pectus excavatum repair. However, the optimal regimen has not been identified. We describe our early experience with intercostal cryoablation for pain management in children undergoing the Nuss procedure and compare early cryoablation outcomes to our prior outcomes using thoracic epidural analgesia. A multi-institutional, retrospective review of fifty-two patients undergoing Nuss bar placement with either intercostal cryoablation (n=26) or thoracic epidural analgesia (n=26) from March 2013 to January 2016 was conducted. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes included telemetry unit monitoring time, total intravenous narcotic use, duration of intravenous narcotic use, and postoperative complications. Patients who underwent intercostal cryoablation had a significant reduction in the mean hospital length of stay, time in a monitored telemetry bed, total use of intravenous narcotics, and the duration of intravenous narcotic administration when compared to thoracic epidural patients. Cryoablation patients had a slightly higher rate of postoperative complications. Intercostal cryoablation is a promising technique for postoperative pain management in children undergoing repair of pectus excavatum. This therapy results in reduced time to hospital discharge, decreased intravenous narcotic utilization, and has eliminated epidurals from our practice. Retrospective study - level III.

Pectus excavatum (PE) can cause cardiopulmonary compression with a wide range of symptoms and psychosocial effects. Few validated surveys assess the extensive symptomatology of the adult pectus population. A comprehensive symptom survey was developed and validated with outcomes presented. An observational and validation study of a novel symptom survey [Phoenix Comprehensive Assessment of Pectus Excavatum Symptoms (PCAPES)] was performed that included patients evaluated for PE from October 2020-September 2021 at Mayo Clinic Arizona. Survey validation was performed in three phases. After survey validation, 432 patients completed the PCAPES survey: median age was 30 years [interquartile range (IQR), 23.0, 39.9 years], 57.8% males, median Haller index: 4.2 (IQR, 3.6, 5.4). Common neurological complaints included headaches (74%) and positional dizziness (67%). Regarding cardiovascular symptoms, 6/7 exercise related questions had at least 70% of patients reporting limitations or inability to perform. Pulmonary-wise, >80% noted restricted breathing both with normal activity and during exercise. For gastrointestinal symptoms, nearly half reported some degree of dysphagia with 52% noting post-prandial dyspnea. Psychosocially, patients reported either avoiding activities where their chest could be visible (68%) or feeling bothered by the overall appearance of their chest (80%). Commonly reported complaints were feelings of depression and anxiety (65% each). Females and older patients (≥30) were more severely affected with cardiac symptoms (P<0.05 for all comparisons). Despite being more symptomatic, females were more likely to feel dismissed by their physicians. Pectus causes a variety of symptoms, and a comprehensive survey should be performed for assessment and indication of further testing.

Pectus excavatum is a common chest wall deformity, most often treated during adolescence, that presents a significant postoperative pain control challenge for pediatric surgeons following surgical correction. The purpose of this article is to review the technique and outcomes of intercostal spinal nerve cryoablation for postoperative analgesia following surgical correction of pectus excavatum. Contemporary and historic literature were reviewed. Findings are summarized to provide a concise synopsis of the benefits of intercostal spinal nerve cryoablation relative to alternative analgesic modalities, as well as advocate for more widespread inclusion of this technique into multimodal pain regimens.

Conventional postoperative pain management, with an intravenous patient-controlled approach or thoracic epidural analgesia, has proved suboptimal following a minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum. Considering its postulated mechanism of action, we encouraged cryoanalgesia as an effective method for postrepair pain management and a possibly superior alternative. A randomized, single-blind clinical trial was tested on patients undergoing pectus excavatum (PE) repair in March and December 2022. Among 101 patients, consenting study participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: cryoanalgesia (group C, n = 24) or noncryoanalgesia (group N, n = 24). Group N received conventional pain management. Comparing the results, pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS-R for resting and VAS-D for dynamic) and the total rescue analgesic consumption was determined. Intrathoracic cryoablation was performed bilaterally on the fourth and seventh intercostal nerves using a cryoprobe at -80°C for 2 minutes. The two groups had similar baseline-patient characteristics; however, group C had a longer mean operative time (159 vs. 125 minutes, p < 0.01) and experienced significantly less pain throughout the postoperative course, with VAS at 6 hours (5.38 vs. 7.04, p < 0.01) and 48 hours (3.17 vs. 5.67, p < 0.01). Cryoanalgesia improved postoperative pain control at rest and during movement following PE repair. However, the outcome was less favorable than expected because the VAS was greater than 4 (moderate pain), although after a day or two, it decreased to lower levels (VAS < 4) in the cyro group. Considering its extra invasiveness and instrumentation, a routine cryoanalgesia procedure for pectus surgery is yet to be determined.

We first utilized and reported on the use of cryoanalgesia for postoperative pain control for Nuss procedure in 2016. We hypothesized that postoperative pain control could be optimized if the intercostal nerve anatomy is better understood. To test this hypothesis, human cadavers were dissected to elucidate the intercostal nerve anatomy. Cryoablation technique was modified. Cadaver Study: Adult cadavers were used to visualize the branching patterns of the intercostal nerves. Cryoablation: Posterior to the mid-axillary line for intercostal nerves 4, 5, 6 and 7, main intercostal nerve, lateral cutaneous branch and collateral branch were cryoablated under thoracoscopic view. Verbal pain scores were obtained from patients one day after the procedure. The study results were obtained during the years 2021 and 2022. Eleven cadavers were dissected. The path of the main intercostal and lateral cutaneous branch lie on the inferior rib surface of the corresponding intercostal nerve. Total of 92 lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerve were dissected and measured as they pierced the intercostal muscle. Most lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerve pierced the intercostal muscle anterior to midaxillary line 78.3%, posterior to midaxillary line 18.5% or on the midaxillary line 3.3%. The collateral branch of the intercostal nerve separated near the spine and traveled along the superior surface of the next inferior rib. Cryoablation: 22 male patients underwent Nuss procedure with cryoanalgesia. Median age of the patients was 15 years (IQR: 2), median Haller index was 3.73 (IQR: 0.85), median pain score (0-10 maximum pain) was 1 (IQR: 1.75). Cryoablation of the intercostal nerve and its two branches improves pain control after a Nuss procedure. Level 4. Observational study.

Despite advancements in minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE), Nuss procedure, postoperative pain control remains challenging. This report covers a multimodal regimen using bilateral single-shot paravertebral block (PVB) and bilateral thoracoscopic intercostal nerve (T3-T7) cryoablation, leading to significant reduction in length of stay (LOS) and high rate of same-day discharge. This is a comparative study of pain management protocols for patients undergoing the Nuss procedure at a single center from 2016 through 2020. All patients underwent the the same surgical technique for the treatment of pectus excavatum at a single center. Patients received bilateral PVB with continuous infusion (Group 1, n = 12), bilateral PVB with infusion and right-side cryoablation (Group 2, n = 9), or bilateral single-shot PVB and bilateral cryoablation (Group 3, n = 17). The primary outcome was LOS with focus on same-day discharge, and the secondary outcome was decreased opioid usage. Eleven of 17 patients in Group 3 (65%) (bilateral single-shot PVB and bilateral cryoablation) were discharged the same day as surgery. The remaining Group 3 patients were discharged the following day with no complications or interventions. Compared to Group 1 (no cryoablation), Group 3 had shorter LOS (median 4.4 days vs. 0.7 days, respectively, p < 0.001) and significantly decreased median opioid use on the day of surgery (0.92 mg/kg vs. 0.47 mg/kg, p = 0.006). Findings demonstrate the feasibility of multimodal pain management for same-day discharge after the Nuss procedure. Future multisite studies are needed to investigate the superiority of this approach to established methods. III.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative cryoanalgesia (cryoablation of the intercostal nerves) during MIRPE. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 64 patients who underwent MIRPE and received cryoanalgesia or epidural analgesia between January 2019 and January 2021. The oral morphine milligram equivalent (MME) was used to calculate the dosage of opioid agents. The median age was 15 years (range, 4-33 years). The median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days (range, 2-6 days), with a median oral MME consumption of 45 mg (ranging from 0 to 1360 mg). Cryoanalgesia was performed in 38 patients, and epidural analgesia was administered to the remaining 26 patients. The cryoanalgesia group had a significantly lesser pain score, shorter postoperative hospital stay and lower oral MME consumption than the epidural analgesia group (5 vs 2; P < .001, 3 days vs 5 days; P < .001, 19 mg vs 634 mg; P < .001). Cryoanalgesia appears to reduce postoperative hospital stay and opioid consumption compared with epidural analgesia. The outcomes of this study indicate that cryoanalgesia might be a safe and effective method for pain control following MIRPE.

Recent studies have shown intercostal cryoablation(IC) during the Nuss procedure decreases hospital length of stay(LOS) and opioid administration. However, few studies have also evaluated the risk of postoperative complications related to IC. We performed a single center retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent Nuss procedure by one surgeon from 2/2016 to 2/2020, comparing intraoperative IC to other pain management modalities(non-IC). Primary outcomes were postoperative complications, hospital LOS, and opioid administration. Multivariate analysis was performed with outcomes reported as regression coefficients(RC) or odds ratios(OR) with 95% confidence interval. IC was associated with decreased hospital LOS (RC -1.91[-2.29 to -1.54], less hospital opioid administration (RC -4.28[-5.13 to -3.43]), and less discharge opioid administration (RC -3.82[-5.23 to -2.41]). With respect to postoperative complications, IC decreased the odds of urinary retention (OR 0.16[0.06 to 0.44]); however, increased the odds of slipped bars requiring reoperation (OR 36.65[5.04-266.39]). Our single surgeon experience controls for surgeon variability and demonstrates intraoperative IC for the Nuss procedure is an effective pain management modality that decreases hospital LOS and opioid use during hospitalization and at discharge; however, it is associated with increased odds of slipped bars requiring reoperation.

Pain is the main factor that determines the postoperative course for patients undergoing pectus bar placement. Cryoablation of the intercostal nerves has been suggested to mitigate this pain. We instituted a protocol for using intercostal cryoablation and report our early results compared to our immediately previous cohort. A retrospective study was conducted on patients undergoing minimally invasive repair for pectus excavatum between January 1, 2017, and August 21, 2017. Demographic data, anthropometrics, operative times, type and duration of patient analgesia, and postoperative length of stay were collected. Descriptive statistics were performed with all means reported ± standard deviations. Comparisons between groups were analyzed on STATA using T-tests with a P value <.05 determined as significant. Twenty-eight patients were treated for pectus excavatum during the study period with 9 (32%) undergoing cryoablation. Mean number of rib spaces ablated was 5 ± 0.53 with no reported intraoperative complications. Mean operative time was 30 minutes longer in the cryoablation group (P = .00). Days to only oral pain medication was shorter in the cryoablation group, (1.22 ± 0.66 day versus 2.63 ± 0.68 day, P = .00). Length of stay, in days, was shorter in the cryoablation group (1.4 ± 0.72 days versus 4.0 ± 1.0 days, P = .00). There were no reported complications from cryoablation or bar placement during the study period. Days to discontinuation of oral narcotics were less in the cryoablation group (8.2 ± 7.0 versus 18.2 ± 10.4, P = .00). Cryoablation after pectus bar placement dramatically decreases narcotic usage and postoperative length of stay.
