Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for automated reading of chest x-rays (CXRs) have been developed and approved for tuberculosis triage in adults but not in children. However, CXR is frequently the only adjunctive tool for clinical assessment in the evaluation of paediatric tuberculosis in primary care settings, and children would benefit from CAD models that can detect their unique clinical and radiographic features. To advance CAD for childhood tuberculosis, large, diverse paediatric CXR datasets linked to standardised tuberculosis classifications are required. These datasets would be used to train and validate paediatric-specific models for tuberculosis screening, diagnosis, and severity stratification. Previous studies on CAD algorithms for reading paediatric CXRs have highlighted promising approaches, including the use of transfer learning with existing deep learning models. Including data from children in CAD models is essential to improve equity and reduce the global burden of tuberculosis disease.

Exercise and manual therapy are recommended for managing non-specific neck pain (NSNP), but most randomised controlled trials (RCT) have not identified specific subgroups that might respond best to each intervention. Although matched exercise was found to be superior to unmatched interventions in the short term, high heterogeneity in effectiveness estimates and variable levels of intervention fidelity and quality of delivery may contribute to inconsistent findings on the effectiveness of matched or stratified care. To assess the quality of intervention reporting and its relationship to treatment effect estimates in RCTs comparing matched versus unmatched exercise or manual therapy interventions for NSNP. Secondary analysis of a systematic review with meta-analysis. For all included RCTs, independent reviewers rated the quality of intervention reporting using the TIDieR checklist. Meta-regression was used to assess the direction and magnitude of association between TIDieR scores and treatment effect estimates (standardised mean difference of change scores) for short-term pain and disability outcomes. The items related to intervention fidelity were not adequately reported. Materials used, intervention provider, location and modification were inconsistently reported. Poorer quality of intervention reporting was associated with larger treatment effect estimates in short-term pain and disability in favour of matched interventions. Trials with inadequate intervention reporting may overestimate the benefits of matched exercise or manual therapy treatments for NSNP. The lack of SUFFICIENT information to judge intervention fidelity in this field reinforces the need for better guidance on this specific aspect of study design, conduct, and reporting.

Depressive symptoms are common in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and are associated with poor disease outcomes. Transcutaneous electrical acupuncture point stimulation (TEAS) is a noninvasive intervention with potential benefits for inflammation but remains untested in IBD. We developed a smartphone application for home-based TEAS self-administration and evaluated its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects. In a randomized feasibility study, IBD patients with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores ≥ 8 were recruited through Crohn's and Colitis UK. Participants were remotely trained to use the TEAS device, locate acupoints, and self-administer the treatment via the app. Group A completed 30-min daily sessions for 21 days from week 1, while Group B started in week 6. Outcomes [recruitment, retention, acceptability, depression, fatigue, pain, and quality of life (QoL)] were assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 9. Of the 109 individuals of interest, 57 were assessed, 37 were eligible, and 36 were randomized. In Group A, 83% (15/18) completed ≥ 18 sessions, compared to 50% (9/18) in Group B. The questionnaire completion rates were 92% ( n  = 33) at baseline, 83% ( n  = 30) at 4 weeks, and 67% ( n  = 24) at 9 weeks. Most participants (81%) recommended TEAS. Preliminary analysis showed reduced depressive symptoms and improved QoL postintervention and at the follow-up. Postintervention, the mean PHQ-9 score decreased from 13.9 to 7.7 in Group A and from 14.2 to 6.5 in Group B. Home-based TEAS is feasible, acceptable, and has a clinical potential. A full-scale randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm its efficacy in the treatment of IBD-related depression.

The archaeological excavations undertaken at the Chalcolithic necropolis of Los Milanes have revealed a previously unknown variability in funerary practices in the south-eastern Iberia. For the first time, a megalithic tomb housed a large funerary deposit (28,740 bone fragments) of exclusively cremated human bone remains. For a comprehensive characterization of the funerary ritual, a cutting-edge multi-proxy approach has been undertaken including the osteological study of cremated bone remains, radiocarbon chronology, Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy in Attenuated Total Reflectance mode (FTIR-ATR), and carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope analyses. As a result, the cremation ritual consisted of multi-depositional events of at least 21 individuals chronologically concentrated in the first quarter of the third millennium, principally in the 28th century cal BC. The absence of charcoal/ashes in the funerary chamber and the underrepresentation of anatomical regions such as lower limb and trunk suggest that the cremation took place elsewhere and the bone remains were carefully collected and placed as secondary burial depositions. Different proxies including colour patterns, heat-induced fractures, the presence of cyanamide in calcined bones would also suggest the cremation of principally complete corpses, burnt soon after death. The ritual of cremation coexisted with inhumations during the third millennium cal BC, suggesting a variability in the body manipulation that previously went unnoticed. Unlike inhumations, through cremation, bodies would have been reduced until being indistinguishable, transforming radically the nature of human beings and their ontological status.

The transition from reconstructive to regenerative strategies in vascular surgery has intensified the need for grafts that are biocompatible, growth-capable, and resistant to thrombosis. Addressing this challenge, Park et al. introduce a groundbreaking method for engineering fully biological, endothelialized tissue-engineered vascular conduits (TEVCs) using decellularized human umbilical arteries (dHUAs) coated with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs). These constructs undergo shear stress training in bioreactors, mimicking physiological blood flow to enhance endothelial functionality and anti-thrombotic properties. Upon implantation in animal models, the grafts showed long-term patency, resistance to thrombosis, and progressive replacement of hiPSC-ECs by host endothelial cells, highlighting their regenerative and integrative potential. The study emphasizes the pivotal role of hemodynamic conditioning and key regulators such as KLF2 in promoting endothelial quiescence and vascular homeostasis. It further explores alternative strategies like endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) and microfluidic systems for flow-induced maturation. Clinically, this approach offers a promising, scalable avenue for patient-specific, immune-compatible vascular grafts applicable in congenital heart disease, dialysis access, vascular grafts and coronary bypass. While challenges such as long-term durability and mechanical reinforcement remain, this research marks a transformative step toward functional, off-the-shelf vascular grafts. Park et al.'s work bridges biomimicry with regenerative medicine, paving the way for next-generation vascular therapies rooted in endothelial mechanobiology and personalized bioengineering.

The medical use of cannabis is expanding across many countries, with some legalizing its use outright and others implementing medical licensure systems to approve treatment for eligible patients. Despite this growing interest and utilization, there remains a lack of solid scientific evidence supporting its medical use, even though cannabis has been used therapeutically for thousands of years. The goal of the following communication is to present updated data on the potential roles of cannabis-based treatments in various autoimmune and rheumatic conditions. The information highlights that incorporating cannabis into the therapeutic armamentarium may offer benefits. However, in many cases, despite encouraging perspectives and outcomes, the supporting evidence remains insufficient and requires further validation. Due to social and legal barriers, the conduct of such rigorous clinical trials has been hindered, limiting the availability of high-quality evidence to guide medical practice.

In the US, children in food-insecure households are at risk for adverse psychological outcomes despite being shielded from hunger and malnutrition by their caregivers and school- and community-based programs. Parenting stress may be an important mechanism through which food insecurity is associated with negative outcomes for child mental health. To investigate associations of household food insecurity with child mental health, parenting stress, and family functioning. This cross-sectional study used a daily-diary design in a community-based sample to examine associations between daily fluctuations in food insecurity and child and family functioning. The study was conducted remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic in the rural (defined by the Health Resource Services Administration) Northeastern US. Caregivers of school-aged children were enrolled during the 2021 school year and completed a baseline visit followed by mobile surveys for 30 days. Participants were adult, legal caregivers of children ages 6 to 12 years who experienced food insecurity within the past month. Participants were required to have English proficiency and access to a device with internet and texting capabilities. Prospective participants completed an online questionnaire to determine eligibility. A total of 553 respondents were screened, of which 327 respondents (59.1%) met all inclusion criteria. The most common reason for ineligibility was not having a child in the study age range. Data analyses were performed between May 2022 and April 2023. Household food insecurity. The primary outcomes were caregiver hunger, negative affect, executive functioning, and parent-child interactions (measured via a daily self-report survey) and child mental health problems (measured via the Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]). Among 61 caregivers (mean [SD] age, 36.1 [5.9] years; 51 women [83.6%]; 2 American Indian or Alaska Native [3.3%], 1 Black [1.6%], and 55 non-Hispanic White [90.2%]), greater day-to-day fluctuations in household and child food insecurity were associated with more severe child internalizing problems (CBCL Internalizing Problems scale: β = 0.40; P = .003 for household and β = 0.49; P < .001 for child food insecurity) and total mental health problems (CBCL Total Problems scale: β = 0.34; P = .01 for household and β = 0.35; P = .01 for child food insecurity). Additionally, the daily association between food insecurity and parent-child conflict was fully mediated via 2 sequential pathways of caregiver hunger and negative affect (b = .02; P = .001) and caregiver hunger and attention and impulse control (b = 0.01; P = .04). This model explained 17% of variability in daily parent-child conflict (R2 = 0.17). This study's findings suggest that caregiver stress and household instability may be key mechanisms by which food insecurity is negatively associated with child mental health.

The relationship between the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) over the next 10 years in the United States is largely unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the association between SII and 10-year CVD risk. This population-based cross-sectional study included 9901 participants aged between 30 and 74 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2018. The 10-year CVD risk was calculated using the Framingham cardiovascular risk score (FRS). The Pearson test, generalized linear model (GLM) and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to analyze the associations between SII and the FRS. Based on the total population, the Pearson test and GLM revealed that there were positive relationships between Ln-transformed SII (Ln (SII)) and the FRS. After adjusting for confounding factors, the odds ratio (OR) for the FRS was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-2.06) per unit increment in Ln (SII) (P = 0.009). Compared to the lowest quartile (Q1) of Ln (SII), the OR for the FRS in the highest quartile (Q4) was 1.89 (95% CI: 1.20-2.98; P = 0.007). RCS revealed that there was a linear association between Ln (SII) and the FRS (P for non-linearity = 0.972). As Ln (SII) increased, the value of FRS rose gradually (P for overall trend <0.001). However, the relationship between Ln (SII) and FRS showed ethnic heterogeneity. In conclusion, SII exhibits significant associations with 10-year CVD risk as assessed by the FRS. However, this association varies across ethnic groups, necessitating cautious application and further validation.
40920085	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Preparatory attentional templates in prefrontal and sensory cortex encode target-associated information.	Visual search relies on the ability to use information about the target in working memory to guide attention and make target-match decisions. The 'attentional' or 'target' template is thought to be encoded within an inferior frontal junction (IFJ)-visual attentional network. While this template typically contains veridical target features, behavioral studies have shown that target-associated information, such as statistically co-occurring object pairs, can also guide attention. However, preparatory activation of associated information within the IFJ-visual attentional network has never been demonstrated. We used fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis to test if target-associated information is explicitly represented in advance of visual search. Participants learned four face-scene category pairings and then completed a cued visual search task for a face. Face information was decoded in the fusiform face area, superior parietal lobule, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the cue period, but was absent during the delay period. In contrast, associated scene information was decoded in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the cue period, and most importantly, in the IFJ and the parahippocampal place area during the delay period. These results are a novel demonstration of how target-associated information from memory can supplant the veridical target in the brain's 'target template' in anticipation of difficult visual search.

"To evaluate the performance of the 2016 revisions to the modified fibromyalgia criteria (FM2016) in identifying individuals with self-reported fibromyalgia in a large population sample, and to test whether simplified symptom thresholds and alternative definitions of widespread pain improve case-finding utility. We used data from 167,184 UK Biobank participants who completed an ""Experience of Pain"" online questionnaire. Logistic regression and clinical utility indices (CUI+ and CUI-) were used to assess the performance of the FM2016 criteria and alternative modifications in case-finding and screening self-reported fibromyalgia diagnoses. Cut-off combinations for the scales of the FM2016, the Widespread Pain Index (WPI), Symptom Severity Scale (SSS), and the Polysymptomatic Distress Scale (PSD) were iteratively optimised. We also compared different definitions of widespread pain, including a single self-reported item on ""pain all over the body"". The FM2016 criteria showed high specificity (98·4 %) but low sensitivity (37·0 %) and case-finding utility (CUI+=0·111). A simplified set of criteria, WPI≥4, SSS≥4, and PSD≥12, conditional on self-reported chronic pain all over the body, improved case-finding utility (CUI+=0·163) while maintaining high screening ability (CUI-=0·974). Other definitions of widespread pain performed less well. In this large population-based study, simplified criteria incorporating a single question on widespread pain and easier-to-apply symptom cut-offs performed marginally better in identifying those with a diagnosis of FM."

Avapritinib (Ayvakit™) is a highly selective inhibitor of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), including D842V mutations. Avapritinib (APB) is authorized in the United States for individuals with metastatic or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). APB is considered the exclusive therapy for adults with indolent systemic mastocytosis. This study established a rapid, validated, and environmentally friendly UPLC-MS/MS method for assessing APB in human liver microsomes (HLMs), applied to assess the APB metabolic stability. The StarDrop software, with the Metabolism and DEREK modules, was utilized to screen for alerts in the APB chemical structure and assess metabolic stability. APB and encorafenib (ECB as the internal standard) were separated using an isocratic mobile phase approach on an Agilent SB-C18 (reversed-phase) column. The APB calibration curve displayed linearity from 1 ng mL-1 to 3000 ng mL-1. The precision and accuracy for intra- and inter-day assessments ranged from 0.53% to 5.67% and -2.18% to 10.33%, respectively. The implemented UPLC-MS/MS approach is ecologically sustainable, utilizing a diminished percentage of an organic solvent (40% acetonitrile), a short elution duration of 1 min, and a low flow rate of 0.35 mL min-1. The metabolic stability characteristics including the intrinsic clearance and the in vitro half-life of APB were determined to be 22.11 mL min-1 kg-1 and 36.67 min, respectively. In silico analysis suggests that minor structural changes to the methyl pyrazole moiety in drug design may improve the metabolic stability and safety relative to APB.

Lymphocytes play critical roles in cancer immunity and tumor surveillance. Radiation-induced lymphopenia (RIL) is a common side effect observed in patients with cancer undergoing chemoradiation therapy (CRT), leading to impaired immunity and worse clinical outcomes. Although proton beam therapy (PBT) has been suggested to reduce RIL risk compared with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), this study used Bayesian counterfactual machine learning to identify distinct patient profiles and inform personalized radiation modality choice. A novel Bayesian causal inferential technique is introduced and applied to a matched retrospective cohort of 510 patients with esophageal cancer undergoing CRT to identify patient profiles for which immunosuppression could have been mitigated from radiation modality selection. BMI, age, baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and planning target volume determined the extent to which reductions in ALCs varied by radiation modality. Five patient profiles were identified. Significant variation in ALC nadir between PBT and IMRT was observed in three of the patient subtypes. Notably, older patients (age >69 years) with normal weight experienced a two-fold reduction in mean ALC nadir when treated with IMRT versus PBT. Mean ALC nadir was reduced significantly for IMRT patients with lower ALC at baseline (<1.6 k/µL) who were overweight or obese when compared with PBT, whereas overweight patients with higher baseline ALC showed clinical equipoise between modalities. Individualized radiation therapy selection can be an important tool to minimize immunosuppression for high-risk patients. The Bayesian counterfactual modeling techniques presented in this article are flexible enough to capture complex, nonlinear patterns while estimating interpretable patient profiles for translation into clinical protocols.

Based on a theoretical analysis of systems composed of subsystems described using a coupled cluster parametrization, we developed a vibrational coupled cluster embedding theory specifically tailored for the computation of response properties. This work identifies several strategies for calculating excitation energies, transition probabilities, and other response functions in large systems of interacting subsystems. A particularly effective embedding approach was formulated around a Lagrangian with multilinear interaction terms, yielding a structure that is nonlinear in both coupled cluster amplitudes and multipliers. Within this framework, we derived the corresponding response functions and associated eigenvalue equations. We also explored partitioning strategies for these equations, resulting in approximate exciton-like models that combine computational efficiency with conceptual clarity. This exciton-inspired methodology establishes a unified framework for computing excitation energies and transition properties in both electronic and vibrational coupled cluster response theories, applicable in both vacuum and embedded contexts. It provides a theoretical foundation for the future development of efficient methods for simulating vibrational spectra in extended systems.

Engaging men as advocates and change agents is a critical mechanism to challenge and reform the social and political factors that impact women's sexual and reproductive health. While there is a growing body of evidence that well-designed interventions can increase males' gender-equitable attitudes and behaviors regarding sexual and reproductive health, most studies focus on men as partners. This paper describes the development and implementation of Men in the Movement, an intervention that provides a safe space for young men of color in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana, to consider a gender-equitable future of manhood, discuss issues that are important to them, and to empower them to become advocates and leaders in their communities. This program trained two male youth education interns to facilitate discussions with about 100 young men of color about sexual health, healthy relationships, social justice, advocacy, and leadership.

To explore the prevalence and distribution of ultrasound-detected lesions indicating structural damage at the enthesis (e.g., bone erosions, enthesophytes, and calcifications) in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA), comparing those with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and to investigate the demographic, clinical, and metabolic factors linked to these lesions. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the DEUS study, a multicentre investigation involving 20 rheumatology centres and including 413 patients with SpA (224 with axSpA and 189 with PsA). All participants underwent standardized clinical and ultrasound assessment of the large lower limb entheses (quadriceps tendon, proximal and distal patellar tendons, Achilles tendon, and plantar fascia). Entheseal structural lesions were explored by ultrasound and classified according to OMERACT definitions. Bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess associations between ultrasound lesions and SpA patients' characteristics. In SpA patients, enthesophytes were the most common lesion (78.7 %), followed by calcifications (43.6 %) and bone erosions (24.9 %). Enthesophytes were more prevalent in PsA (86.8 %) compared to axSpA (71.9 %) (p < 0.001), with no significant differences in erosions and calcifications. However, lesion distribution varied across different entheses. Multivariate analysis revealed that entheseal erosions were significantly associated with inflammatory markers, HLA-B27 positivity, clinical enthesitis, and longer disease duration. Enthesophytes were significantly linked to PsA, psoriasis, clinical enthesitis, and longer disease duration. Calcifications were positively associated with hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. All lesions were associated with biologic DMARD use. This study reveals a high prevalence of ultrasound-detected structural damage at the enthesis and identifies distinct SpA phenotypes based on these findings.

The global funeral economy, following advancements and innovations in virtual and artificial intelligence, has witnessed explosions in the diversification and commodification of burial services, especially bereavement and mourning rituals. This phenomenon has prompted scholars to investigate what is termed 'affection as a service' - technological innovations and products with affordances that allow the bereaved to reconnect posthumously with their loved ones. In this article, I examine yet another growing phenomenon: that of hired, itinerant professional mourners in Ghana. Here, I argue that by appropriating and blending a mode of cultural expression of grief with their unique style of nwomkro performances, these professional keeners have not only revived an essential tradition for the purposes of cultural continuity, but they have also commodified mourning enactments for financial gains.

Inflammation and immune mediators exacerbate COVID-19; turmeric and ginger possess antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that may mitigate this response. This study compared the effects of turmeric and ginger on inflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19. This triple-blind randomized clinical trial enrolled 144 COVID-19 outpatients at Kowsar Hospital (Semnan, Iran) in 2021. Participants were randomly allocated to group C (turmeric), group G (ginger), or group P (placebo) using blocked randomization and consumed three 500 mg tablets daily for five days (15 tablets total). Inflammatory markers-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)-were measured at baseline and on day 6. LDH and WBC levels did not differ significantly among groups (p = 0.349 and p = 0.663, respectively). Changes in CRP and ESR varied significantly across groups (p < 0.001), with greater reductions observed in the turmeric and ginger groups compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001), and no difference between the turmeric and ginger groups (CRP: p = 0.263; ESR: p > 0.99). Turmeric and ginger exerted equivalent anti-inflammatory effects; therefore, either agent may serve as a complementary therapy alongside standard treatment to reduce CRP and ESR in COVID-19 outpatients.

Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) refers to the active collaboration of patients and the public in health and social care research decision-making, enhancing research success, cost-effectiveness, and impact. Children, young people, and their families bring unique lived experiences to PPI in research, relating to others with similar experiences, while factors like age, cognitive maturation, and developmental stage create differences between researchers and patients or the public. Collaboration with children, young people, and their families should be guided by specific project context and a strong evidence base. However, existing systematic reviews reveal inconsistencies in reporting and a lack of standardised methods for these groups, limiting effective PPI implementation. This protocol details methods for an umbrella review to identify the current state-of-science and future priorities for collaborating with children, young people and families in health and social care research. The protocol was developed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines, which will also direct the reporting of findings. The Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology for conducting umbrella reviews will be adhered to throughout. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane, DARE, JBI Evidence Synthesis, PROSPERO, grey literature databases, targeted international networks, and the Google search engine will be searched for systematic reviews on PPI with children, young people, and families in health and social care research. Two reviewers will independently conduct eligibility screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal. This umbrella review will provide critical insights into the state-of-science of PPI with children, young people and families in health and social care research. The synthesis of findings could yield important information for researchers and other stakeholders conducting health and social care research in collaboration with children, young people and families by highlighting key patterns, gaps, and recommendations to guide future PPI practices, policies, and research.

Antipsychotic drug (AP)-induced glucose homeostasis changes are often attributed to AP-induced weight gain. Nevertheless, dysregulated glucose control can occur independently of weight gain. To examine the association between AP use and glucose homeostasis while considering weight gain propensity, medication type, and treatment duration. MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science were searched from inception through February 3, 2025. Blinded randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing changes in glucose homeostasis-related parameters between patients with severe mental illness or healthy volunteers assigned to AP or control (placebo or no intervention) groups were included. Studies were limited to English-language human studies without restrictions on study length, AP type, or previous AP exposure. Of 22 773 unique citations, 163 RCTs met inclusion criteria, with 127 studies included in the meta-analysis. Each article was screened independently by 2 authors using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were completed using a standardized spreadsheet. Data were analyzed via random-effects meta-analysis, with subgroup analyses for diagnosis, study length, AP type, age, concomitant medication use, and previous AP exposure. Metaregressions identified covariate effects. Data analysis was completed from October 2023 to February 2025. Primary study outcomes were changes in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) following AP treatment. Secondary outcomes included any other glucose metabolism-related parameters including, but not limited to, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. A total of 35 952 AP-treated patients and 19 010 placebo-treated patients were included in the qualitative synthesis, while 28 975 AP-treated and 15 101 placebo-treated patients were included in the meta-analysis. AP use was associated with significantly increased fasting glucose (mean difference [MD], 0.72 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.54-1.08 [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]; P < .001), fasting insulin (MD, 1.94 μIU/mL; 95% CI, 1.28-2.61 [to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 6]; P < .001), glycated hemoglobin (MD, 0.04%; 95% CI, 0.02%-0.05% [to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01]; P < .001), and hyperglycemia (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.59; P = .02) vs placebo. Findings were corroborated in healthy volunteers. Subgroup analyses suggested that AP type, diagnosis, age, concomitant medication use, and previous AP exposure do not consistently affect dysglycemia risk. In metaregression analyses, AP-associated dysregulations in glucose homeostasis were independent of study length and AP dose. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, results indicate that AP exposure significantly disrupts glucose homeostasis independent of exposure time, dose, diagnosis, and weight gain propensity. Increased awareness of AP-induced dysregulations in glucose homeostasis alongside ongoing metabolic monitoring and potential treatment is warranted.

Chemokine levels may predict kidney graft rejection. This study evaluated whether adding early plasma chemokines C-X-C motif ligand 9 (CXCL9) or chemokines C-X-C motif ligand 10 (CXCL10) measurements to a standard-of-care model improves the prediction of the need for antirejection treatment and helps guide biopsy decisions. The benchmark model used recipient and donor age, human leukocyte antigen mismatches, and dialysis need in the first 3 days after transplantation. Plasma CXCL9 or CXCL10 was added, and the extended models were evaluated using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), flexible calibration curves, and net benefit analysis. Model internal validation was performed through bootstrapping. Among 163 consecutively transplanted recipients on standard immunosuppression, 43 (26.4%) required antirejection therapy between Days 3 and 21 posttransplant. The chemokine-extended models outperformed the benchmark (LRT p < 0.01), increasing discriminative ability (delta ROC-AUC of 0.02) and improving calibration. Across the range of risk thresholds for biopsy, the extended models provided better clinical utility, resulting in up to 17 fewer unnecessary biopsies per 100 patients. These findings suggest that adding plasma CXCL9 or CXCL10 to a benchmark model can improve patient care by reducing the number of biopsies in individuals unlikely to require antirejection therapy.

Rapid diagnosis of resistance-conferring mutations to antibiotics used for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) is critical for patient care and public health control efforts. Prior guidelines included the use of fluoroquinolones (FQs) for the treatment of drug-resistant TB, including multidrug-resistant TB, pre-extensively drug-resistant TB, and extensively drug-resistant TB. More recently, a short-course regimen for antibiotic-susceptible TB was introduced, which includes the use of a FQ, a drug class that diagnostic algorithms in the United States (US) typically do not test for if all first-line agents are susceptible. However, FQ mono-resistance has been documented by previous studies, and for this reason, we tested 319 archived Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains spanning a 14-year period of time using the Xpert MTB/XDR assay. Resistance to FQs was detected in 4.4% (14/319) of the isolates tested, with mutations predominating in the gyrA region (13/14; 92.9%). A single isolate (1/14; 7.1%) was found to have a gyrB mutation. A broth microdilution assay demonstrated the minimum inhibitory concentrations for resistant strains that ranged from 0.5 µg/mL to 8.0 µg/mL. Importantly, three strains were FQ mono-resistant and would have been completely missed by standard testing algorithms. Although currently unavailable in the US, the GeneXpert XDR assay has the potential to fill the significant diagnostic gap in susceptibility testing of MTBC resistance to FQs and support the use of the currently recommended short-course regimen.IMPORTANCE This study provides insight into the need for additional rapid testing for the detection of drug resistance (specifically to fluoroquinolones) in tuberculosis (TB) cases in the United States (US). The current regimens for TB treatment rely on knowing resistance patterns to optimize treatment, and missed resistance could have a negative impact on the health of the patient, as well as contribute to increased drug-resistance mutations in new TB cases. There are currently limited platforms for expanded rapid drug resistance testing for TB cases in the US, and this study looks at past TB cases that had drug resistance missed by routine testing.

Degenerative lumbar conditions are a leading cause of disability worldwide, often requiring surgery when conservative treatments fail. Data on surgical outcomes from patients' perspectives and influencing factors remain limited. This study aimed to assess 1-year and 2-year Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) following lumbar spine surgery and identify factors associated with these outcomes. This surgery registry study included 1,195 adult patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery between 2017 and 2022 at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Patients completed the EQ-5D-3L and Oswestry Disability Index before surgery, as well as one year (n = 741) and two years (n = 440) after surgery. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors influencing PRO improvements at the dimension level. The mean age of the patients was 58.1 years (SD 16.1). From baseline to 1-year, patients experienced the largest improvements in pain/discomfort (δ = 0.55-0.56) and social functioning (δ = 0.48-0.53), while improvements in activities of daily living and functional tasks were smaller, with negligible change in lifting (δ = 0.04); these effects largely persisted at the 2-year follow-up. Patients with poorer baseline PROs consistently improved across all PROs at the 1-year follow-up. Higher education and conditions affecting only the L4/5 spinal level were associated with better outcomes in activities of daily living, pain/discomfort, and social functioning. Higher education and a prolapsed disc diagnosis were associated with functional task improvements. At year two, poorer baseline PROs remained influential, while the absence of comorbidities emerged as a significant factor. Substantial improvements in pain/discomfort and social functioning domains occurred within the first year and persisted into year two, while physically demanding tasks such as lifting remained difficult to restore. Patients with poorer baseline PROs and higher education derived the greatest benefit, emphasising tailored pre-operative interventions to optimise outcomes.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease globally, with rising prevalence linked to metabolic syndrome (MetS). Excessive liver fat accumulation (steatosis) worsens disease progression and MASLD prognosis. Moreover, gut microbiota dysbiosis might promote steatosis, accelerating the disease progression to severe stages. Identifying gut microbiota signatures specific to steatosis severity might improve its diagnosis and inform personalised interventions in MASLD. This study aimed to characterise associations between gut microbiota composition and hepatic steatosis severity in a cohort of patients with MASLD/MetS. Ultimately, we aimed to assess the potential for microbiota features to enhance the diagnosis of severe steatosis. A cross-sectional cohort of 61 patients with MetS with extensive clinical history was recruited at different stages of MASLD. Transient elastography was used to evaluate liver fibrosis and steatosis severity. Participants' faecal microbiota were profiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Statistical analyses first identified correlations between microbiota profiles and patients' phenotypes, while disentangling important confounders such as medication. Identified features were then used to build predictive models for diagnosing severe steatosis. High steatosis severity was distinctly associated with a higher prevalence of the inflammation-associated Bacteroides 2 (Bact2)-enterotype, accompanied by a lower proportion of beneficial commensals (eg, Akkermansia) and a higher proportion of opportunistic bacteria (eg, Streptococcus). Patients harbouring a Bact2-enterotype reached severe steatosis at lower Fatty Liver Index (FLI) thresholds. Using Bact2-carrier status together with FLI in a predictive model significantly improved the classification of severe steatosis (accuracy 90%, receiver operating characteristics 96%) when compared with FLI alone. Gut microbiota composition and dysbiosis (defined as Bact2-enterotype) are distinctly associated with steatosis severity in MASLD/MetS. Patient stratification by microbiota composition enhances the diagnostic classification of severe steatosis in MASLD, suggesting a potential for personalised interventions in patients with microbiota dysbiosis.

Cachexia accounts for about 20% of all cancer-related deaths and it is indicative of poor prognosis and progressive functional impairment. The role of the gut microbiome in the development of cachexia in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients has not been established. Pre-surgical stool samples from n = 103 stage I-III CRC patients in the ColoCare Study were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Illumina) to characterize fecal bacteria. We calculated estimates of alpha- and beta-diversity and a priori- and exploratory-selected bacterial relative abundance. Using Fearon criteria, cachexia onset at 6 months post-surgery was defined as > 5% weight loss over the past 6 months and/or body mass index (BMI) of < 20 kg/m2 and weight loss of > 2%. Associations of microbial metrics with cachexia onset were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models. Higher alpha-diversity was positively associated with cachexia onset, with stronger associations in females, patients < 65 years, those receiving adjuvant treatment, consuming high fiber, or with energy intake outside USDA recommendations (p < 0.05). Porphyromonas (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.26-0.89, p = 0.03) and Actinomyces (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.48-1.03, p = 0.08) were inversely associated with cachexia, although the association for Actinomyces did not reach statistical significance. Stratified analyses revealed a stronger inverse association between Porphyromonas and cachexia onset in males, patients with rectal or stage III tumors, those receiving neoadjuvant treatment, physically inactive individuals, and those consuming low fiber. However, these associations did not reach statistical significance (0.05 ≤ p < 0.10). Higher gut microbial alpha-diversity and lower relative abundances of the genera Porphyromonas and Actinomyces in pre-surgery stool samples were associated with onset of cachexia in CRC patients six months post-surgery. This is the first study to explore a link between the gut microbiome and cachexia in CRC patients, providing novel insights into the biology of cachexia and potential clinical interventions.

COVID-19 pandemic led to a fast vaccine design due to the threat of rapid spreading worldwide. Safety profile of the approved vaccines has been achieved mostly through clinical trials. However, some unsolicited adverse events in a longer duration of time have been recorded in addition to the late disorders known as long-COVID, stemming from classical infection. Therefore, case studies and long-term follow-up are required to enrich the current data on SARS-COV-2 infection/vaccination. In this study, two cases of autoimmune diseases induced by COVID-19 and/or vaccination were followed in three years. The profile of each is presented, and the probable cause has been discussed. The laboratory findings approved systematic lupus erythematosus and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in the studied cases. The key finding of this study is that the importance of probable autoimmune diseases flares up in individuals with a history of autoimmunity in their families which could manifest as a long-COVID symptom or late vaccination side effect.

This study investigates how sustained governance of hidden hazards influences safety performance in port systems, using data from 54 production and key non-production enterprises within the Tianjin Port Group. Employing correlation analysis, regression modeling and mediation-moderation analysis, the study finds that both systematic hazard governance and standardized safety management significantly improve safety outcomes. Basic management-level governance directly reduces the frequency of incidents, while site-level governance enhances safety performance indirectly by promoting standardization. Moreover, the overall risk level of hidden hazards moderates the effectiveness of these governance strategies. The study confirms the alignment between hazard inspection frameworks and safety management systems, and proposes a closed-loop model to support continuous improvement and long-term risk control in high-risk port environments.

Monkeypox (mpox) is an emerging infectious disease with increasing global incidence. Limited evidence exists regarding its impact on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes, especially in low-resource settings. The objective was to systematically synthesize current evidence on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with mpox infection during pregnancy. A systematic review was conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase (as of 4 September 2024) databases were searched. Case reports, case series, cohorts, and observational designs were included. Duplicates were removed using Rayyan. Only 6 studies (out of 471) met the eligibility criteria. A descriptive analysis was conducted due to heterogeneity and small sample sizes. A total of 6 studies were included (4 from US, 1 from Spain, 1 from Democratic Republic of Congo), comprising 33 pregnant women aged 18-29 years. Mpox was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 32 cases. The clinical symptoms included vesicular rash, genital lesions, and systemic manifestations. No maternal deaths were reported. Adverse fetal outcomes included miscarriage (9.1%), stillbirth (6.1%), and 4 intrauterine deaths. Most pregnancies (84.8%) resulted in live births. The reported complications included oligohydramnios, cholestasis, chorioamnionitis, and fetal tachycardia. One study confirmed vertical transmission via placental and fetal tissue analysis. Mpox infection during pregnancy is associated with significant risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Although current evidence is limited, these findings highlight the urgent need for more robust data to inform clinical and public health guidance.

Galectin-10(Gal-10)/CLC(Charcot-Leyden crystal) has been discovered to be related to ECRSwNP characterized by high eosinophilic infiltration. We aimed to investigate the effects of Gal-10 on ECRSwNP. A total of 36 tissue samples were collected, including 11 ECRSwNP samples, 15 non-ECRSwNP samples, and 10 Control samples. Human eosinophils were divided into 3 groups: Control, siRNA-NC, and Gal-10 interference groups. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) detected the expression of Gal-10 in the tissues samples and expression of p-p38 and p-p65 in human eosinophils. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was adopted to measure the expression levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, MBP, ECP, and TNF-α in the human eosinophils. We found the expression of Gal-10 was significantly higher in ECRSwNP group (P < 0.05). The expression levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, MBP and TNF-α in the Gal-10 interference group were lower (P < 0.05), but ECP had no statistical difference in human eosinophils. There showed the expression levels of p-p38 and p-p65 proteins in the Gal-10 interference group were lower (P < 0.05). The deletion of Gal-10 in eosinophils down-regulates the expression of cytokines and granule cationic proteins in ECRSwNP which may be caused by the p38MAPK/ NF-κB pathway.

Population pharmacokinetic models can potentially provide suggestions for an initial dose and the magnitude of dose adjustment during therapeutic drug monitoring procedures of imatinib. Several population pharmacokinetic models for imatinib have been developed over the last two decades. However, their predictive performance is still unknown when extrapolated to different populations, especially children. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of these published models on an external real-world dataset containing data from both adults and children. A real-world dataset was collected, containing observations from adult and pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive/Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia (N = 39) treated with imatinib. A systematic review through PubMed was conducted to identify qualified population-pharmacokinetic models for external evaluation (i.e., prediction-based, simulation-based, and Bayesian forecasting diagnostics). Standard allometric scaling was used for models that were developed based on data from adults only. Fifteen published models were found for evaluation, of which only two were based on data from both children and adults. Prediction-based diagnostics showed that some models had an acceptable level of bias. The model by Shriyan et al. (with allometric scaling) performed best with a median prediction error of 1.24%. However, no models performed well on precision even when allometric scaling was used, where the lowest median absolute prediction error was 37.66% using the model by Schmidli et al. The models by Golabchifar et al. and Schmidli et al. (both with allometric scaling) performed the best of all tested models, with a median prediction error ≤ 15%, median absolute prediction error ≤ 40%, fraction of prediction error within ± 20% (F20) ≥ 0.3, and within ± 30% (F30) nearly 0.4. Simulation-based diagnostics showed that most of the observations outside the 90% prediction interval were from children. Bayesian forecasting showed that the model prediction could be improved using one prior sample, particularly in adults. Current models fail to accurately predict imatinib plasma concentrations in our real-world dataset, especially for children. Future pharmacokinetic studies should focus on developing better models for pediatric populations.

As the demand for humanistic and patient-centered care grows in clinical practice, integrating narrative medicine into residency training has become increasingly important. This study aimed to investigate the narrative competencies of obstetric residents undergoing standardized training and to evaluate the effectiveness of narrative medicine education empowered by case-based teaching in enhancing clinical practice and professional competency. A total of 46 obstetric residents enrolled in standardized training programs between October 2021 and May 2024 were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 23) or the control group (n = 23). Residents in the experimental group received case-based narrative medicine education, while those in the control group received conventional clinical teaching. Following the obstetrics rotation, knowledge tests and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) were administered. Subjective evaluations of narrative competencies and teaching effectiveness were assessed using validated questionnaires. After the obstetrics rotation, OSCE scores were significantly higher in the experimental group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Narrative competencies also showed a significant improvement among residents in the experimental group after the training (P < 0.05). Moreover, residents in the experimental group reported higher narrative competency scores and greater satisfaction with teaching effectiveness compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Narrative medicine education empowered by case-based teaching effectively enhances narrative competencies, obstetric clinical skills, doctor-patient communication abilities, critical thinking, and learning engagement among obstetric residents undergoing standardized training. This innovative teaching approach addresses the gap in humanistic medical education and provides an effective strategy for cultivating comprehensive professional competency in obstetric residents.

Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic, refractory type of stomatitis characterized by abnormal keratinization and often accompanied by pain. The best treatment for OLP, particularly for pain management, remains unclear. This study focuses on the short-term efficacy of ibuprofen gargle for pain relief in patients with OLP. In this crossover study, 24 patients with painful OLP were enrolled. One group received an ibuprofen gargle (0.6%) on days one and three to five and a placebo on day two. The other group received a placebo on day one and ibuprofen on days two to five. The primary outcome was the change in pain level, measured by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before and after gargling on days one and two. Additionally, changes in each domain of the Patient-Reported Oral Mucositis Symptom (PROMS) scale were evaluated from days one to five. There was no significant difference in the degree of reduction in pain VAS values between the ibuprofen and placebo groups before and five and 15 minutes after use of the gargle. However, the PROMS scale showed a significant reduction in dietary restrictions (p = 0.032) in favor of the ibuprofen gargle compared to baseline. Ibuprofen gargle may help alleviate dietary restrictions associated with oral intake in patients with OLP who experience pain. This study was registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT) (jRCTs051220009).

Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCDLBCL-LT), is an uncommon and aggressive subtype of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, typically affecting elderly women and predominantly involving the lower extremities. Its diagnosis relies on immunohistochemical profiling and clinical presentation. We report a rare case of a 45-year-old male presenting initially with scalp and supraciliary plaques. The early diagnosis suggested tumor-stage mycosis fungoides, based on histopathology and immunophenotype (CD4+, CD20-). However, over time, the patient developed disseminated nodular lesions, with new biopsies revealing CD20+, MUM1+, BCL2+, Ki-67 70%, and MYC expression, consistent with PCDLBCL-LT. Despite multiple lines of systemic therapy, including R-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone combined with rituximab), methotrexate, gemcitabine, platinum-based chemotherapy, and autologous stem cell transplant, the disease progressed, ultimately leading to the patient's death. This case highlights an atypical clinical presentation of PCDLBCL-LT in a young male, initially mimicking T-cell lymphoma. The diagnostic evolution underscores the importance of repeated biopsies and immunohistochemical reevaluation in persistent or atypical cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders. It also raises awareness of CD20-negative variants and potential coexistence with T-cell lymphomas such as mycosis fungoides.

We reviewed those diagnosed pre- and postnatally with interrupted inferior caval vein (IICV), emphasizing the computed tomographic (CT) findings in those without complex cardiac malformations. We identified cases of IIVC diagnosed between January 2013 and December 2024. We defined non-complex cardiac malformations as secundum atrial communications with or without catheter intervention or surgery, mild semilunar valve stenosis, or a patent ductus arteriosus with or without catheter intervention or surgery. We identified 51 cases of IIVC, of which 49 had prenatal care. Of the 49 with prenatal care, 46 (94%) were diagnosed prenatally. Of the 46 prenatally diagnosed, 5 underwent fetal demise, 1 elective termination, and 40 were live born. Of the 45 live born (5 non-prenatally and 40 prenatally diagnosed), 31 (69%) had no complex cardiac malformation. Of these 31, 10 (32%) underwent CT scanning. In our experience, we noted a high prenatal detection rate for IICV, with most having no complex cardiac malformations. Further, CT scanning in a subset of patients without complex cardiac malformations demonstrated elements of left-isomeric situs, including left-atrial appendage isomerism.

Myogenic temporomandibular disorder (MTMD) is a complex disorder of the masticatory apparatus. Many nonsurgical treatments have been introduced for treating MTMD chronic pain. The aim of this study is to test the effect of Nd-YAG laser versus epidermal growth factor (EGF) on painful chronic MTMD through monitoring pain scores and salivary pain mediators' levels. Twenty-seven patients with chronic painful MTMD, refractory to conventional treatments, were included in this study. Group I (n = 13) was treated using Nd-YAG Laser. Group II (n = 14) was treated by intramuscular EGF injections. Pain score using the numerical rating scale (NRS, 0-10), salivary nerve growth factor (NGF, mg/dL), and salivary glutamate (Glu, mg/dL) were measured at baseline (day 0), 1, and 3 months. NRS decreased significantly in both groups at 1 and 3 months compared to baseline. However, group II patients only showed a significant increase in NRS at 3 months compared to 1 month. In response to both treatments, NGF levels decreased significantly at 1 month compared to baseline. However, NGF levels at 3 months were significantly higher than baseline in both test groups. Glu levels showed a significant decrease in group II patients only at 1 and 3 months compared to baseline. The results of this clinical trial have shown, for the first time, that Nd-YAG laser and EGF intramuscular injection can offer effective non- to minimally invasive treatment options for pain alleviation in chronic MTMD. Salivary NGF is a promising noninvasive sensitive biomarker for chronic painful MTMD. EGF intramuscular injection had a direct effect on salivary Glu levels. This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT06044974.

To assess Vitamin D status in children aged 0-6 years in Quanzhou, China, and compare the impact of diagnostic criteria on deficiency/sufficiency classification. This cross-sectional study enrolled 1,183 healthy children aged 0-6 years (January 2022-March 2023). Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured via ELISA, and anthropometric data were collected. Participants were stratified by sex, season, age, WLZ, BMI, and Vitamin A status to analyze Vitamin D variations. Diagnostic criteria impacts on classification were evaluated. Mean serum 25(OH)D was 73.02 nmol/L (IQR: 58.48-89.09), with no sex-based differences (P > 0.05). Levels varied by season (highest in summer: 75.85 nmol/L; lowest in winter: 69.00), and age (infants > toddlers > preschoolers), all P < 0.05. Serum 25(OH)D were observed to decrease with increasing WLZ (Weight-for-Length Z-score) and BMI, though no statistically significant differences were found for either parameter (both P > 0.05) Using Criterion I, 2.46% were deficient, 9.97% insufficient, and 87.57% sufficient (χ2  = 1589.053, P < 0.001). With Criterion II, rates shifted to 12.43, 40.74, and 46.83%, respectively (χ2  = 239.271, P < 0.001). Classification discrepancies were significant across subgroups (sex, season, age, BMI; all P.adj <0.05), with poor inter-criteria agreement (Kappa = 0.071, P < 0.001). Age, season, BMI, and Vitamin A independently predicted sufficiency (P < 0.05). This study underscores two critical implications: (1) Vitamin D deficiency/sufficiency classifications are critically dependent on diagnostic criteria, necessitating region-specific guidelines and standardized threshold selection in practice and research. (2) Given the influence of latitude on Vitamin D synthesis, targeted interventions-particularly increased winter dosing for young children-should be tailored to age and seasonal variations.

Patient-derived cancer organoids (PDCOs) are a valuable model to recapitulate human disease in culture with important implications for drug development. However, current methods for rapidly and reproducibly assessing PDCOs are limited. Label-free imaging methods are a promising tool to measure organoid level heterogeneity and rapidly screen drug response in PDCOs. This study aimed to assess and predict PDCO response to treatments based on mutational profiles using label-free wide-field optical redox imaging (WF ORI). WF ORI provided organoid-level measurements of treatment response without labels or additional reagents by measuring the autofluorescence intensity of the metabolic co-enzymes NAD(P)H and FAD, and the optical redox ratio, defined as the fluorescence intensity of [NAD(P)H/NAD(P)H+FAD], was used to measure the oxidation-reduction state of PDCOs. Development of leading-edge analysis tools helped to maximize the sensitivity and reproducibility of treatment response measurements using WF ORI in colorectal (CRC) PDCOs. Leading-edge analysis improved sensitivity to redox changes in treated PDCOs. Additionally, WF ORI resolved FOLFOX treatment effects across all PDCOs better than two-photon ORI, with an approximately 3-fold increase in effect size. WF ORI distinguished metabolic differences based on driver mutations in CRC PDCOs, differentiating between KRAS+PIK3CA double mutant PDCOs and wildtype PDCOs with 80% accuracy, and identified treatment resistant mutations in mixed PDCO cultures. Overall, WF ORI enables rapid, sensitive, and reproducible measurements of treatment response and heterogeneity in colorectal PDCOs that will impact patient management, clinical trials, and preclinical drug development.

Sensitivity to medical adhesives, such as Leukoplast, can lead to significant skin reactions, complicating wound management. While systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for severe adhesive hypersensitivity, the adjunctive role of moist wound dressings in optimizing local wound healing and patient comfort remains underexplored. A 70-year-old woman with hyperthyroidism and hypertension developed blood blisters 4 h after leukoplast adhesive application during hospitalization for seizures. Referred to wound care, clinical assessment revealed dermal coagulation, inflammation, erythema, and peri-wound pain. Prior history included adhesive hypersensitivity with hives and pruritus. Following blister aspiration and debridement, hydrocolloid dressings were applied to sustain moisture, alongside systemic hydrocortisone, cefazolin, and nutritional support. Follow-up showed progressive healing without maceration, highlighting moisture retention's role in epithelialization. The TIME framework guided tissue, inflammation, and moisture management, emphasizing individualized care to avoid further adhesive exposure. This case underscores the effectiveness of moist wound dressings combined with pharmacological and nutritional interventions in managing adhesive sensitivity. Ensuring a moist wound environment is crucial for healing. This approach highlights the need for personalized wound care strategies to address adhesive sensitivities effectively.

Results from the GEMSTONE-303 trial indicate that compared with placebo plus capecitabine and oxaliplatin (PLA-CAP), sugemalimab plus capecitabine and oxaliplatin (SUG-CAP) as first-line therapy provides clinical benefits for patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) adenocarcinoma with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) ≥5. However, the addition of sugemalimab increases medical costs. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SUG-CAP vs. PLA-CAP for the first-line treatment of advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma with PD-L1 CPS ≥5 from the perspective of China's healthcare system. A Markov model with three health states was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of SUG-CAP and PLA-CAP. Clinical data were obtained from the GEMSTONE-303 trial, drug costs were determined based on national bidding prices, and other costs and utility values were obtained from published literature. Outcomes included total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analysis was used to verify the robustness of the model. The SUG-CAP incurred costs of $70,673.28 and gained 1.28 QALYs. In the PLA-CAP, the effectiveness was 1.00 QALYs at a cost of $11,241.52. Compared with PLA-CAP, SUG-CAP yielded an increase of 0.28 QALYs at an incremental cost of $59,431.76. The ICER for SUG-CAP vs. PLA-CAP was $217,686.71 per QALY, which exceeds the preset willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $41,511 per QALY, with a 0% probability of being cost-effective. The parameters that significantly affected the model were the cost of sugemalimab, progression-free survival (PFS) utility, and discount rate. From the perspective of China's healthcare system, SUG-CAP as first-line therapy for advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma with PD-L1 CPS ≥5 is not cost-effective compared with chemotherapy alone.

To evaluate long‑term outcomes of corneal patch grafting (CPG) and to determine prognostic factors for anatomical and functional success. This retrospective study included 35 eyes from 35 patients who underwent CPG between April 2016 and September 2022 at Adana City Training and Research Hospital. Collected data included age, sex, preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), graft localization and size, anterior segment findings, graft survival, secondary surgical procedures, and rates of anatomical and functional success. Anatomical success was achieved in 82.9% (29/35), and functional success in 45.7% (16/35). The most common reason for CPG was non-infectious, non-traumatic perforation related to immune disorders (37.1%). Anatomical success was not significantly associated with the primary etiology (p = 0.73), whereas functional success was significantly higher in patients with traumatic corneal perforations (p = 0.029). A statistically significant improvement was observed in postoperative BCVA for the study group (p < 0.001). Functional success was significantly associated with younger age and peripheral graft location (p = 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). Smaller graft diameter was significantly correlated with both higher anatomical and functional success (p = 0.031 and p = 0.007, respectively), while no significant association was found with horizontal graft diameter (p = 0.27 and p = 0.068, respectively). Corneal patch grafting is a highly effective technique for restoring anatomical integrity in most patients and provides acceptable functional outcomes in selected cases. Younger age, peripheral graft location, and smaller graft diameter appear to be favorable prognostic factors for functional recovery.

This study examined head and neck cancer treatment outcome priorities in patients with human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal cancer (HPVOPC) before and 12 months (12m) after (chemo)radiotherapy ([C]RT). Eligible patients were diagnosed with HPVOPC suitable for curative-intent primary [C]RT. Study data included responses to a modified version of the Chicago Priorities Scale (CPS-modified) and select items from the MDASI Head and Neck Cancer Module (MDASI-HN). Analysis included descriptive statistics, McNemar's test for binary matched-pairs and general linear models. The CPS-modified was completed by 99 patients before [C]RT, 91 12m after [C]RT and 90 at both assessments. Treatment outcomes classified as top priorities were comparable before and 12m after [C]RT: 'being cured of my cancer' (cure, 93%/91%), 'living as long as possible' (survival, 69%/66%), 'being able to swallow all foods and drinks' (swallow, 56%/56%), 'having a normal amount of energy' (energy, 51%/48%) and 'having no pain' (pain, 51%/48%). After [C]RT, cure and survival were ranked highest (1 of 13) by 65/90 (72%) and 12/90 (13%) patients, respectively, and swallow was ranked above cure, survival, pain, energy, 'keeping my normal sense of taste and smell' (senses) and 'having a comfortably moist mouth' (moist mouth) by 14%, 36%, 47%, 55%, 56% and 66% of patients, respectively. More patients identified senses and moist mouth as a top priority 12m after [C]RT than before [C]RT (26%/44%, p=0.002; and 19%/39%, p=0.003, respectively). Select MDASI-HN symptom severity scores did not differ by CPS-modified priority groupings (top versus middle/lower) 12m after [C]RT (all p>0.05). For HPVOPC patients, the most important treatment outcome priorities are stable before and 12m after [C]RT. After C[RT], only 56% of HPVOPC survivors considered swallowing a top priority. Patient priorities should be considered when designing future de-escalation treatment strategies, considering the excellent outcomes with standard treatment.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with severe pain. We examined whether an ultrasound-guided, single-injection L2 erector spinae plane block could improve analgesia compared to an ultrasound-guided iPACK (infiltration between the popliteal artery and capsule of the knee) block with adductor canal block (ACB) in patients undergoing TKA under spinal anesthesia. Ninety patients aged 65-89 years of both sexes (ASA I-III) scheduled for TKA were randomly allocated to receive iPACK block (ropivacaine 0.2%, 20 mL) with ACB (ropivacaine 0.2%, 10 mL), lumbar erector spinae plane block (L-ESPB) (ropivacaine 0.2%, 20 mL on each side), or to the control group. The primary outcome was total opioid consumption. The secondary outcomes included pain scores, time to first rescue opioid analgesia, quadriceps muscle strength, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet- to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). The total opioid consumption in 48 h was significantly lower in the iPACK+ACB group (mean ± SD) (3.0 ± 3.3) compared to L-ESPB (6.8 ± 3.8, P = 0.0442) and the control group (18.2 ± 4.0, P < 0.001). The time to first rescue opioid analgesia was longer in the iPACK+ACB (12.0 ± 1.9) compared to the L-ESPB (9.2 ± 1.9, P < 0.001) group and the control group (4.3 ± 1.1, P < 0.001). The pain scores, NLR, and PLR levels were significantly lower in the iPACK+ACB and L-ESPB groups than at all time points in the control group. The iPACK+ACB is more effective than L-ESPB in pain management following TKA. iPACK+ACB and the L-ESPB lowered total opioid consumption and prolonged time to first opioid analgesia. NLR and PLR levels did not differ between the groups.

"Healthcare providers (HCPs) are essential in providing care and working with families with small and sick newborns throughout the perinatal care continuum. While clinical experience, education, and training influence HCPs' attitudes and skills regarding family involvement in care, the specific factors affecting Ghanaian HCPs remain unclear. To identify HCPs' characteristics that influence their attitudes and self-perceived practice skills toward involving families in the perinatal care continuum for small and sick newborns. This analytical cross-sectional study involved 141 HCPs, including nurses, midwives, and medical staff, from one secondary and 13 primary healthcare facilities in Ghana. Participants completed an online survey using two standardized scales: (1) ""Family Importance in Nursing Care-Nursing Attitudes"" which assesses HCPs' perceptions of the significance of family involvement in care and the (2) ""Family Nursing Practice Scale"" which evaluates the extent to which HCPs integrate family-systems approaches in their practice. Data analysis involved multiple linear regression models. Self-perceived practice skills and attitudes towards family involvement influenced HCPs in multiple dimensions, including viewing ""family as a burden"" (associated with increased stress), ""as a conversational partner"" (as active participants in care), and as a ""resource in care"" (having their own coping resources). Availability of a family systems care work approach and prior education in family systems care significantly influenced HCPs' self-perceived practice skills. HCPs skills and attitudes in family involvement influenced each other. Transforming attitudes towards family systems care across all levels, from hospital to home, should aim to improve the quality of newborn care. Tailored family systems care education, skills training, and institutional support are needed to enhance HCPs' skills and attitudes across the perinatal care continuum for small and sick newborns."

Sleep disorders, including insomnia, are highly prevalent in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), significantly impacting quality of life. Patients frequently use cannabidiol (CBD) as an alternative to standard medical treatments for sleep disorders, yet its efficacy has not been rigorously investigated. This study comprises 15 randomized, placebo-controlled N-of-1 trials evaluating the effect of pure CBD oil (10 % g/v) on sleep quality in MS patients. Each N-of-1 study consists of a two-week run-in period, followed by four treatment periods of three weeks, separated by a one-week washout. Participants receive both CBD and placebo twice in a randomized order. Treatment starts at 150 mg daily, increasing to 300 mg from week 2. Study outcomes are assessed during the final two weeks of each block. The primary outcome is sleep quality, measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcome measures of sleep recorded in a sleep-wake diary, and scores on the Checklist Individual Strength Fatigue-subscale (CIS-F), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Additionally, as a continuous proxy for fatigue, smartphone keyboard interactions will be collected using the Neurokeys application. Results from the individual N-of-1 trials will be aggregated for group-level analyses. This study aims to provide insight into the effects of a controlled CBD product on sleep quality in MS patients through an N-of-1 trial design. Given the substantial variability in sleep quality and the anticipated interindividual differences in CBD response, an N-of-1 design is considered a suitable methodological approach.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterised by arterial, venous or microvascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity. Bone infarct, or avascular necrosis (AVN), is seen in up to 2.9% of patients with primary and secondary APS. Multiple bone infarcts, defined as involvement of three or more bony sites, are reported in 3%-10% of the patients with a history of corticosteroid use, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and hypercoagulable states, including APS. The femoral head, knees, shoulders and ankles are commonly affected, while involvement of the ribs or vertebrae is rare. A young age of onset (≤30 years), an SLE damage index ≥1, a higher mean glucocorticoid dose, coexisting arthritis and a positive antiribonucleoprotein antibody are associated with a higher risk of AVN in a few SLE cohorts. In APS, thrombosis of the skeletal vessels is a possible mechanism for AVN in addition to trauma, dyslipidaemia, etc. Our patient, a young woman, presented with an acute onset of back pain, a new onset of accelerated hypertension and recurrent pregnancy loss. Over 1 month, she developed bone pain at multiple sites, including the distal radius, bilateral tibia and T11-L3 spine. A Tc 99 triple-phase bone scan revealed a bone infarct, and with further investigations, she was diagnosed with SLE with secondary APS. She was initiated on immunosuppression and anticoagulation.

Hair transplant surgery is often tended to as a last resort for different types of alopecia. It involves importing hair from a donor site to recipient site using different surgical tools. Surgical interventions hold the risk of causing complications, due to the penetration of skin and exposure of internal tissue to tools and outer environment. This work systematically investigates reported complications of hair transplantation surgery in the literature. An electronic search was performed on databases: PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv, and Google Scholar. Recovered articles were systematically filtered through titles and abstracts, and then through full-text review. After filtration, included articles were subjected to data extraction through a specialized data extraction form. Data were then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. This review included 45 articles that were divided under two categories: 24 case reports describing 27 cases and 21 observational studies. Mean age of included patients was 40.46 ± 13.5 years in cases and 40.31 years for non-case studies. In cases, 20 (74%) patients reported donor-site complications early after surgery, and 25 (92.6%) late complications. At the recipient site, 6 (22.2%) patients reported complication early, and 8 (29.6%) patients reported delayed complications. In observational studies, 442 patients reported complications out of 2353 included in reviewed studies. Pain and discomfort were the most reported complications. In cases, 6 (22.2%, p = 0.32) patients reported pain at the donor area and observational studies included 281 (63.57%) pain-complaining patients. Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) were reported in 11 patients (40.7%, p = 0.073) and were associated with the use of punch graft technique for FUE. Hair transplant surgery is generally safe. Pain, swelling, and edema at the donor site were the most often reported complications. At the recipient site, scarring was reported most. A few cases of donor-site AVF were reported in the literature and were often associated with FUE with punch graft technique.

To examine temporal trends in sexual identity and sociodemographic disparities in Sweden after gender-neutral marriage legislation in 2009. Methods. We analyzed 3 cross-sectional surveys from the Stockholm Public Health Cohort (2010, 2014, 2021) that included 76 083 participants 16 years or older. Weighted Poisson regression was used to estimate associations between sexual identity and sociodemographic covariates. Survey weights and multiple imputation addressed sampling design and nonresponse. Results. Bisexual identity doubled between 2010 and 2021, from 2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8%, 2.4%) to 4.3% (95% CI = 3.8%, 4.7%) among females and from 1.0% (95% CI = 0.8%, 1.2%) to 1.9% (95% CI = 1.6%, 2.3%) among males. In 2021, 15.1% (95% CI = 12.5%, 17.7%) of Generation Z (1997-2012) females and 6.9% (95% CI = 5.8%, 8.0%) of Millennials (1981-1996) identified as bisexual; the figures for males were 4.2% (95% CI = 2.8%, 5.7%) and 2.4% (95% CI = 1.7%, 3.1%). Bisexual identity was associated with lower income and never-married status, although the strength of the associations decreased over time. Conclusions. The rise in bisexual identity, particularly among younger generations, likely reflects shifting societal and cultural norms. Income and marital disparities persist but have narrowed. Public Health Implications. Public health should support bisexual individuals as part of broader efforts to promote equity amid evolving norms. (Am J Public Health.

Alkali salt-doped ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolyte systems for energy applications, owing to their excellent interfacial stability. To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li+). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr14][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions xLiTFSI ≤ 0.3. We find that the charge-charge and density-density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI-doped [pyr14][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density-density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the xLiTFSI-sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems.

This study aims to cross-culturally validate the Dutch version of the Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey-Head and Neck version 2.0 (LSIDS-H&N v2.0). This questionnaire assesses the impact of lymphedema and fibrosis symptoms in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients in terms of symptom intensity and related distress. The convergent validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency of the Dutch LSIDS-H&N v2.0 were investigated in 30 HNC patients. Convergent validity was examined by correlating LSIDS-H&N v2.0 scores with four other questionnaires: the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30 v3.0), Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF), Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey version 2.0 (VHNSS v2.0). Eleven hypotheses were tested. Ten out of 11 hypotheses (91%) were accepted, confirming very strong convergent validity. The Dutch LSIDS-H&N v2.0 demonstrated strong to very strong test-retest reliability (ICCs of 0.792 to 0.963). Very strong internal consistency was demonstrated (Cronbach's α ranging from 0.883 to 0.981). The Dutch LSIDS-H&N v2.0 proved to be a reliable and valid tool for assessing symptom burden and distress in HNC patients with potential lymphedema and/or fibrosis.

This study explored the application value of iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation (IDEAL-IQ) technology in the early diagnosis of ageing osteoporosis (OP). 172 participants were enrolled and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations on a 3.0T scanner. 100 cases were included in the normal group (50 males and 50 females; mean age: 45 years; age range: 20-84 years). 33 cases were included in the osteopenia group (17 males and 16 females; mean age: 55 years; age range: 43-83 years). 39 cases were included in the OP group (19 males and 20 females; mean age: 58 years; age range: 48-82 years). Conventional T1WI and T2WI were first obtained, followed by 3D-IDEAL-IQ-acquisition. Fat fraction (FF) and apparent transverse relaxation rate (R 2 ∗) results were automatically calculated from IDEAL-IQ-images on the console. Based on T1W and T2W-images, 300 ROIs for each participant were manually delineated in L1-L5 vertebral bodies of five middle slices. In each age group of all normal subjects, each parameter was significantly correlated with gender. In male participants from the normal, osteopenia, and OP groups, statistical analysis revealed F values of 11319.292 and 180.130 for comparisons involving FF and R 2 ∗ values, respectively (all p < 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of FF values were 0.906 and 0.950, 0.994 and 0.997, 0.865 and 0.820, respectively. For R 2 ∗, they were 0.665 and 0.616, 0.563 and 0.519, 0.571 and 0.368, respectively. In female participants from the normal, osteopenia, and OP-groups, statistical analysis revealed F values of 12461.658 and 548.274 for comparisons involving FF and R 2 ∗ values, respectively (all p < 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of FF values were 0.985 and 0.991, 0.996 and 0.996, 0.581 and 0.678, respectively. For R 2 ∗, they were 0.698 and 0.730, 0.603 and 0.665, 0.622 and 0.525, respectively. Significant differences were indicated in the quantitative values among the three groups. FF value had good performance, while R 2 ∗ value had poor performance in discriminating osteopenia and OP-groups. Overall, the IDEAL-IQ technique offers specific reference indices that enable noninvasive and quantitative assessment of lumbar vertebrae bone metabolism, thereby providing diagnostic information for OP.

This third version of the seating guidelines aims to deliver a practical guide, using the most up to date research and evidence on pressure ulcer prevention and management. This guide can be applied to adults who remain seated for extended periods of time across health and social care settings. In the UK, over 700,000 patients are affected by pressure ulcers each year; 180,000 of those are newly acquired and their treatment is estimated to cost the NHS £3.8 million every day. Therefore, guidelines that have been written for people living or working in health and social care are essential. Within the guidelines the authors explore how and where pressure ulcers develop when seated, the potential risk factors, the best possible seated position, ideal seating assessment, and who might be involved and what interventions can one expect after a seating assessment. The guidelines then go on to examine cushion and static chair selection, cushion covers, wheelchairs, and the use of tilt, recline, and elevating leg rests. Finally there is an examination of self-help strategies to prevent pressure ulcers, the key outcomes for those who remain seated for long periods and standards for procuring and testing cushions and static chairs.

Public health data systems have limited ability to provide timely, population-level information for people with severe and multiple disadvantages, such as individuals with recent homelessness or incarceration. To generate prevalence estimates for physical health, mental health, and substance use conditions in a statewide cohort that included individuals with recent incarceration or homelessness. This observational cohort analysis was completed in July 2025 and used linked statewide electronic health record (EHR) and administrative data through the Minnesota Electronic Health Record Consortium (MNEHRC) and its Health Trends Across Communities project. Adults with an encounter at a MNEHRC-participating health system between 2021-2023. Statewide directly standardized, age and sex-adjusted, prevalence rates of 22 health conditions chosen by public health, healthcare, and research leaders in Minnesota, stratified by recent homelessness, jail incarceration, or prison incarceration. This cohort included 4,362,645 individuals (53% female, 73% white), including 20,139 individuals with recent homelessness, 51,470 individuals with recent jail incarceration, and 4,889 individuals with recent prison incarceration. Individuals with recent homelessness or jail or prison incarceration had a higher prevalence of asthma (14.9%, 9.6%, 10.1% respectively, vs. 7.1%) and COPD (10.5%, 6.1%, 5.5%, respectively, vs. 3.0%) compared to the general population. Individuals with recent homelessness had the highest rates of mental health disorders compared to other included groups; recently homeless Black individuals had the highest recorded rates of psychotic disorder diagnoses (18.7%) across racial and ethnic groups experiencing homelessness. Substance use disorders among individuals with recent homelessness or jail or prison incarceration, including opioid use disorder (13.9%, 10.6%, and 13.6%, respectively, vs. 1.4%), were higher compared to the general population. Our findings highlight widespread disparities among people with recent homelessness or incarceration, particularly related to mental health and substance use conditions. Payment and delivery models that account for high levels of co-occurring health and social complexity are needed.

Climate change presents a growing mental health concern for older adults, particularly among Korean and Korean American populations who may experience heightened vulnerabilities due to cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic factors. This study examines the psychological impact of climate change on this demographic, focusing on three key areas: increased vulnerability to climate-related disasters, the exacerbation of social isolation, and the role of resilience in mitigating negative outcomes. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, this study explores how environmental stressors, displacement, and disruptions to traditional support systems contribute to mental health challenges. Furthermore, it highlights protective factors such as cultural resilience, intergenerational support, and community-based interventions that can help older Korean and Korean American adults adapt to climate-related stressors. The findings underscore the need for culturally responsive mental health strategies, policy initiatives, and social support networks to promote psychological well-being and climate adaptation in aging populations.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older adults hospitalized with heart failure. A total of 210 patients (mean age 80.99 ± 8.32 years; 65.24% female) participated in the study. The standardized EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire was used as the main instrument to assess HRQoL.The average health status assessment on the EQ VAS scale in the study group of patients was 56.03 ± 18.81. Patients reported the greatest mobility problems, with 25.71% of them having severe walking problems and 7.62% of patients being unable to walk. 22.39% of respondents had serious problems with performing everyday activities or were unable to perform them at all. Nearly one fifth of patients experienced severe or extreme pain or discomfort (19.05%). Physical activity turned out to have a significant impact on motor skills (p < 0.001), self-care (p < 0.001), usual activities (p < 0.001) and anxiety/depression (p = 0.001). In conclusion, the quality of life of older patients hospitalized due to HF is reduced compared to the general population. The most prominent issues are pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. A number of socioeconomic factors influence the quality of life of patients with HF.
40893169	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article;Review	A systematic review of user-based usability testing practices in self-care mHealth apps.	Self-care mobile health (mHealth) apps empower users to manage their health independently by supporting symptom tracking, medication adherence, and lifestyle changes. Given the limitations of mobile platforms, such as small screens and limited input capabilities, usability is a critical factor influencing the successful adoption of these apps. This article presents a systematic review of user-based usability testing practices in self-care mHealth applications. A total of 68 primary studies were retrieved and analyzed from the Scopus database, published between 2014 and 2024, following established systematic review protocols. The review revealed a growing research interest in usability testing for self-care mHealth apps. Usability testing commonly employs mixed-method approaches, combining standardized questionnaires, such as the System Usability Scale, with qualitative methods (think-aloud protocols and interviews). A diverse group of participants, including patients and healthcare professionals, was used for testing. Testing was conducted in both controlled (labs and hospitals) and uncontrolled (homes) environments. The core usability attributes, ease of use, engagement, and satisfaction, were widely used. The review offers actionable insights for researchers seeking to improve the usability of self-care applications. Further research is needed in several directions: justifying the appropriate sample size for participants, expanding the scope of usability testing to include underexplored attributes, and conducting longitudinal usability studies, and so on.

Neck pain and headaches often co-occur, and the presence of degenerative cervical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings has been associated with the presence of headaches. However, previous studies have not provided conclusive evidence about their association, and imaging studies examining the associations between headache severity and MRI findings have been suggested. This study aims to investigate the associations between independent variables, single MRI findings, and an aggregate score of MRI findings, and the outcome variable, headache severity. This cross-sectional study examined patients with neck pain and headaches in specialist care. MRI findings and outcome measures were collected at the time of clinical entrance between 2011 and 2014. The headache severity was assessed using the Neck Disability Index questionnaire. Ten degenerative MRI findings were routinely evaluated, and an overall score was derived by aggregating single findings across levels C2-C7. Univariate and multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses assessed the associations expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). A total of 574 patients were included. Higher headache severity was significantly associated with female sex and younger age. The presence of single cervical MRI findings was linked to lower odds of severe headaches (ORs < 1), and having two or three findings further decreased the likelihood (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23-0.68) compared to having none. A sensitivity analysis assessed the OR estimates for the aggregate score as robust. This study showed that, among patients with persistent neck pain referred to secondary care, degenerative MRI findings in the cervical spine were inversely associated with headache severity. The association between an aggregated score of MRI findings and headache severity was stronger than that of single findings. These findings reflect associations observed within a selected clinical population and warrant further investigation in populations with differing symptom profiles.

Rapid advancement of flexible electronics has generated a demand for sustainable materials. Cellulose, a renewable biopolymer, exhibits exceptional mechanical strength, customizable properties, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. These attributes are largely due to its hierarchical nanostructures and modifiable surface chemistry. This paper systematically reviews the molecular and structural properties of cellulose, clarifying the relationships between structure, performance, and application for its multifunctional uses in next-generation devices. Advanced processing techniques-including 3D printing, freeze-drying, and chemical modifications-facilitate the integration of cellulose with conductive polymers and nanomaterials to create multifunctional composites. These innovations are pivotal for breakthroughs in ultra-sensitive flexible sensors, self-powered nanogenerators, high-capacity energy storage systems, and biomimetic electronic skins. The environmental adaptability and tissue compatibility of these composites make them particularly suitable for wearable health monitors and biodegradable electronics. Challenges related to scalability and multifunctional integration are being addressed through molecular engineering and sustainable manufacturing practices approaches like solvent-free 3D printing. By converging nanotechnology with principles of a circular economy, cellulose-based systems are redefining sustainable electronics and bridging human-centered design with eco-intelligent solutions.

Statin adherence impacts cardiovascular outcomes, yet disparities persist. Understanding sociodemographic factors and barriers is crucial for targeted interventions. To investigate the relationship between sociodemographic factors and statin adherence across racial and ethnic groups. This retrospective study examined sociodemographic factors, prescription records, clinical factors, and responses from the Demographic, Drug Exposure, Healthcare Utilization Survey (HUS) in the All of Us (AoU) cohort. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed the impact of sociodemographic factors on adherence stratified by race. Adult participants with statin prescription records. Subgroup analyses included those who responded to the HUS. Statin prescription. Percent days covered (PDC), calculated as the proportion of days within a year in which a person prescribed a statin filled a prescription. Adequate adherence was defined as PDC ≥ 80%. Of the 17,029 participants with a statin prescription, the mean statin PDC was 57%, with 66% reporting a PDC ≤ 80%. Racial and ethnic differences in adherence were observed, with Non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants having a median PDC of 74% (IQR [0.25,0.98]), Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) 49% (IQR [0.25,0.98]), and Hispanic participants 25% (IQR [0.08,0.49]). NHW participants faced employment barriers (OR 0.63, 95% CI [0.46, 0.86]) and provider inaccessibility (OR 0.56, 95% CI [0.40, 0.76]) as significant factors for lower adherence. NHB participants experienced patient anxiety (OR 0.53, 95% CI [0.30, 0.90]) and financial barriers (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.50, 0.85]), while Hispanic participants showed patient anxiety (OR 0.14, 95% CI [0.02, 0.60]) and immigrant status (OR 0.36, 95% CI [0.17, 0.76]) as significant factors for lower adherence. To address cardiovascular disease disparities, it is crucial to recognize unique sociodemographic barriers to statin adherence within racial and ethnic groups. Our findings highlight the need for tailored strategies considering the diverse barriers each group faces. Targeted interventions can bridge adherence gaps and improve cardiovascular outcomes across populations. This approach recognizes that while race and ethnicity may correlate with specific barriers, it is the underlying SDoH that often play a pivotal role in statin adherence. Question: What are predictors and barriers to statin adherence in the All of Us cohort?Findings: Among 17,029 statin users, 57% reported low statin adherence, which varied by racial and ethnic groups and was associated with social determinants of health (SDoH). For Non-Hispanic Whites, employment barriers and provider inaccessibility were linked to lower adherence. Non-Hispanic Blacks faced patient anxiety and financial barriers, while Hispanics' adherence was impacted by immigrant status, healthcare coverage and patient anxiety.Conclusions: Unique SDoH influence statin adherence among diverse populations. Tailored interventions addressing specific barriers are needed to improve adherence and reduce cardiovascular disease risk equitably and effectively.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common anatomical malformation among live-born infants and has been linked to various prenatal factors. Maternal sleep disturbances, a common issue during pregnancy, have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal health problems. However, epidemiological evidence on the association between maternal sleep disturbances and the risk of CHD in offspring remains limited and inconclusive. This study aimed to evaluate the association between maternal sleep disturbances during pregnancy and the risk of CHD in offspring. A total of 8514 mother-child pairs from the Early Life Plan cohort were included in this study. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep characteristics during the first trimester of pregnancy. CHD was diagnosed through ultrasound. Logistic regression models were employed to analyze the association between maternal sleep problems during pregnancy and the risk of CHD in offspring. Poor maternal sleep quality (OR = 1.58, 95 % CI: 1.04-2.40) and short sleep duration (OR = 1.59, 95 % CI: 1.06-2.38) were both significantly associated with an increased risk of CHD in offspring. Subgroup analysis revealed that poor sleep quality was significantly associated with a higher risk of CHD in male offspring (OR = 1.75, 95 % CI: 1.04-2.96), but this association was not significant in female offspring. Among mothers with a habit of daytime napping, shorter sleep duration (<7 h) was significantly associated with a higher risk of CHD (OR = 1.82, 95 % CI: 1.06-3.14). When examining sleep duration as a continuous parameter, longer sleep duration was associated with lower risk of CHD (OR = 0.81, 95 % CI: 0.66-0.98) in daytime napping group. Poor sleep quality and short sleep duration during pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of CHD in offspring, while the observed relationships appeared more pronounced in male offspring and among mothers who engaged in daytime napping. Daytime napping might have a potential protective effect in reducing the risk of CHD in offspring. As this is an observational study, a causal relationship cannot be established, and further validation is needed in future research.

This descriptive study quantifies the supply of epilepsy-certified physicians across the United States. We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology's verifyCERT system to identify active epilepsy-certified physicians as of October 24, 2024. Physician locations were matched to county-level Federal Information Processing Standard codes and assigned Area Deprivation Index (ADI) scores and Urban Influence Codes. We aggregated physicians at regional, state, and county levels and calculated patient-to-physician ratios using state-level estimates of active epilepsy cases. Of 2,284 physicians with epilepsy certification, 2,169 were active. There were zero epilepsy-certified physicians in Montana, and only 1 in each of Arizona, Vermont, and Wyoming. California, New York, and Texas had the highest physician supply. The South had the highest number of epilepsy cases and highest patient-to-physician ratios. Most epilepsy physicians were in metropolitan areas, but many of these counties lacked any epilepsy-certified physicians. Counties with more physicians had lower ADI scores, reflecting worse access to care in areas with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation. Our study highlights geographic heterogeneity in supply of epilepsy-certified physicians. The distribution of epilepsy subspecialists should inform interventions that improve quality of care.

The effectiveness of colonoscopy largely depends on the quality of bowel preparation. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used but has certain limitations. This review evaluates whether combining PEG with linaclotide improves preparation efficacy and safety compared with PEG alone. A search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to October 2024. Only randomized controlled trials comparing PEG combined with linaclotide versus PEG alone and reporting adenoma detection rates (ADR) or polyp detection rates (PDR) were included. Mean differences (MDs) and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. A total of eight studies, including 3,071 participants, were included. Pooled analysis indicated that PEG combined with linaclotide was significantly associated with a higher ADR (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.03-1.28), higher Boston bowel preparation scale score (MD, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.02-0.61), and greater willingness to repeat colonoscopy (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08-1.24). Although PDR (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.89-1.24) was numerically higher in the intervention group, the difference was not statistically significant. Additionally, the intervention significantly reduced the incidence of nausea, vomiting, bloating, and abdominal pain. PEG combined with linaclotide is a safe alternative to PEG alone, improving ADR, bowel preparation quality, and patient comfort.

Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the most prevalent malignant thoracic tumor in childhood and young adults. This study reports the outcome of a national cohort treated in an international prospective trial for a localized rib ES, with a long follow-up. All the patients treated in a prospective trial (December 1999-April 2013) were included. Data were collected from a prospective database and supplemented by a retrospective review of the patients' files. Local control alone rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Multivariate analyses were conducted to adjust for classical prognosis factors. Eighty-two patients, median age 13.6 years, were included. All received induction chemotherapy. Surgery was completed (R0) in 88%. Overall, 66% had good histological response (GR). Radiotherapy (RT) was performed on the primary tumor in 28%, on the hemithorax in 13%, or on both in 32%. With a median follow-up of 12 years, 28 patients (34%) relapsed. Five-year local control rate was 95% (95%CI [89%-95%]), 5-year PFS was 73% (95%CI [62%-81%]), and 5-year OS was 79% (95%CI [69%-87%]). In multivariate analysis, pleural effusion was significantly associated with poor PFS (p = 0.049). In the case of R0 and GR (n = 41), no significant difference in PFS/OS (p = 0.16/p = 0.36) was reported according to adjuvant local RT. Overall, 38% of scoliosis and 7.3% of secondary cancer were reported. A multidisciplinary approach in high-risk patients can provide good local control in rib ES. In patients who have undergone R0 surgery and are GR, omitting adjuvant RT of the surgical bed may be discussed.

Background Suicide represents a serious global public health challenge and a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in adolescents. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and some determinants of suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts among school-going adolescents in the Wasit Governorate, Iraq. Methodology This was an updated, wide-scale cross-sectional study targeting public governmental middle- and high-school students aged 13 to 18 years. Schools and students were selected using a standardized two-stage cluster sampling design. A pretested Arabic Version of the Iraqi Global School-Based Student Health Survey questionnaire was used in addition to demographic and psychosocial variables, including parental socio-economic status and history of suicidal behaviors among family members and friends. All procedures were performed under ethical standards. The survey data analysis was performed using the primary sampling unit (PSU) and finite population correction (FPC) methods with a baseline univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression to measure the associated factors. Results A total of 1810 students from 42 middle and high schools were included, with a mean age of 15.98 years. Boys formed 50.27% of the study population. The overall 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts was 23.87% (95% CI: 19.65-28.67), 21.90% (95% CI: 18.04-26.32), and 22.37% (95% CI: 18.60-26.65), respectively. In the univariate analysis, suicidal behavior, and thoughts had significant associations with gender, social status, residency, parental conflict, and the presence of suicidal behavior history in family and friends. In the multivariate full-model analysis, the risk factors for suicide attempts were girls (adjusted odds ratio or AOR 1.64; 95% CI; 1.05-2.58), exposure to suicide attempts in family members (AOR 3.36, 95% CI: 1.60-7.06) and friends (AOR 1.99, 95% CI: 1.26-3.15). Suicidal ideation (AOR 11.81, 95% CI: 7.59-18.40) and planning (AOR 8.06, 95% CI: 4.30-15.10) were the most important associated risk factors for suicide attempts. Conclusion Suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts are alarmingly prevalent among school-going adolescents in Wasit, particularly among girls and those with a history of suicide attempts in friends and family members. Suicidal ideation and planning strongly relate to suicide attempts. Multi-level and collaborative efforts toward preventing the onset of ideation, planning, and attempts are crucial.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most prevalent skin cancer and carries a favorable prognosis when treated early. Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is the standard of care for large BCCs greater than 2 cm on the trunk or extremities, given its ability to achieve a high cure rate while maximizing preservation of healthy tissue. While arborizing telangiectasias are a hallmark feature, locally advanced tumors may demonstrate more obvious varicosities that warrant more rigorous preoperative planning. Herein, we present a case of a large BCC on the upper back with pronounced varicosities draining into the right internal jugular vein treated with MMS. Preoperative imaging and clinical evaluation were important for ensuring treatment success in this locally advanced BCC. The tumor cleared in one stage, and a 14-month follow-up revealed no tumor recurrence and regression of the aberrant vascularization.

The antioxidant capacity and mechanism of linusorbs (LOs) on lipid systems with different unsaturation was unclear. This study aimed to explore the oxidative stability of flaxseed oil (FO), walnut oil (WO), and camellia oil (CO) in the presence of LOs in order to recognize the impacts of unsaturation degree of the lipid systems on the performance of natural antioxidants. By the evaluation of fatty acid compositions, PV/CD and AV/p-AV value, and changes of characteristic peaks in Raman spectra, LOs can inhibit oil oxidation in different lipid systems, especially potent for C18:3-based FO, followed by C18:2-based WO, and C18:1-based CO. The inhibitory mechanism was indicated that LOs sacrifice themselves to terminate lipid peroxide and free radical, and the different inhibitory efficacy might be due to the different participation degree of LOs in the main chain reaction and side chain initiation of lipids oxidation principle.

Depression ranks as the second leading cause of the global health burden; therefore, identification of its risk and influencing factors is essential to develop more effective multidimensional interventions. The aim of the present study was to analyze the mediating role of family adaptability (FA) on the relationship between insecure attachment (IA) and family functioning (FF) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), which currently remains unclear. It also aims to provide a theoretical reference for optimizing rehabilitation interventions. This cross-sectional study enrolled 62 patients with MDD who were admitted to a tertiary hospital in Beijing from March 2024 to December 2024. Participants completed the General Information Questionnaire, Family Assessment Device, Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale, and the Experiences in Close Relationships Relationship Structures Scale. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was also administered. Subsequently, association analysis was performed. Notable correlations were observed among IA, FA, and FF in adults with MDD. Regression analysis established both IA and FA as reliable predictors of FF. Bootstrap-mediated analysis revealed that FA partially mediated the relationship between IA and FF, accounting for 35.47% of the total association. Further analysis demonstrated differential mediation proportions; FA mediated 39.36% of the association between anxious IA and FF and 42.61% of the association between avoidant IA and FF, with all mediation pathways meeting conventional thresholds for statistical significance. IA in adult patients with MDD negatively impacts FF, with both anxious and avoidant IA subtypes showing independent negative associations partially linked by FA. Rehabilitation strategies should prioritize multidimensional interventions targeting the enhancement of FA to improve FF and facilitate clinical recovery.

Familial cerebral cavernous malformation (fCCM) is characterized by multiple brain lesions affecting quality of life. PROMIS-29 (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29) is a quality of life survey validated in some neurological diseases but not in fCCM. We assessed the reliability, validity, and association of PROMIS-29 in fCCM with clinical symptoms and with the modified Rankin Scale. PROMIS-29 surveys assessing 7 quality of life domains were completed by 198 patients with fCCM ≥18 years old in the Brain Vascular Malformation Consortium cerebral cavernous malformation study. Raw domain scores were converted to T scores standardized to a reference population (mean 50±10) and tested using intercept-only regression (P≤0.05). Linear mixed models tested whether domain scores were associated with age, sex, clinical symptoms at time of first survey, or with modified Rankin Scale score. PROMIS domains had high reliability (Cronbach α >0.85). Patients with fCCM reported significantly worse anxiety (52.71 [95% CI, 51.23-54.20]), pain (52.50 [95% CI, 50.93-54.07]), and physical functioning (52.96 [95% CI, 51.40-54.52]), but better social participation (46.95 [95% CI, 45.35-48.54]) versus reference. Prior intracranial hemorrhage was associated with worse anxiety (+3.11 [95% CI, 0.10-6.12]), fatigue (+3.68 [95% CI, 0.61-6.76]), physical functioning (+3.79 [95% CI, 0.74-6.84]), and social participation (+4.42 [95% CI, 1.28-7.56]). Headaches were associated with worse depression (+3.17 [95% CI, 0.18-6.17]), fatigue (+4.14 [95% CI, 0.70-7.59]), pain (+3.88 [95% CI, 0.40-7.37]), and sleep disturbance (+2.94 [95% CI, 0.03-5.85]). Modified Rankin Scale score was weakly to moderately and positively associated with all domains except sleep disturbance (0.01≤R2≤0.55). PROMIS domains were reliable and correlated with modified Rankin Scale score and symptoms in fCCM, identifying affected domains beyond physical functioning. Future studies should determine whether changes in health domains are associated with fCCM disease severity and further evaluate clinical usefulness of PROMIS.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is used to reduce breast cancer size before surgery, allowing for breast conservation surgery (BCS) instead of mastectomy. However, concerns exist about higher positive margins and local recurrence rates. This study compared the incidence of positive margins, local recurrence rates, and other oncologic outcomes of BCS performed either upfront or after NACT. We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study of 122 patients treated at the American University of Beirut Medical Center between July 2011 and September 2016. Patients who underwent BCS whether upfront or after chemotherapy were matched 1:1 based on disease stage and molecular subtype. We matched 61 breast cancer patients treated with BCS following NACT to those treated with upfront BCS. Patients in the NACT group were younger, with a mean age of 45 years compared to 52 years in the upfront group. In the NACT group, 31 (51.7 %) have high-grade disease. Most patients received adjuvant radiation therapy. Positive margins were found in 14 patients in the NACT group and 5 in the upfront group (p = 0.03). Local recurrence was 8.6 % in the NACT group versus 1.7 % in the upfront group (p = 0.086). 5 years disease free survival was significantly lower 81 % in the NACT group versus 95 % in the upfront group (p = 0.03). Overall survival was not significantly different in the NACT group compared to the upfront group (p = 0.574). Breast cancer treated with BCS after NACT has a low incidence of positive margins and similar oncologic outcomes compared to BCS performed upfront.

Although current prescribing guidelines suggest continuation of psychotropic drugs in pregnant women, population-based evidence supporting their safety is limited. This study aims to clarify the plausible causal links between maternal psychotropic drug exposures and obstetric complications. This cohort study investigated all births by Hong Kong residents ≥18 years of age in public hospitals between 2004 and 2022. Birth episodes were classified according to whether they were unexposed to psychotropic drugs, exposed but discontinued before conception or exposed during pregnancy. Firth's penalised logistic regression was employed in all analysis, and negative control analysis was conducted to assess causality. False discovery rate correction and sensitivity analyses were performed. Among 587 419 births, 7182 episodes involved psychotropic prescriptions (antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines) during pregnancy. In broad drug class analysis, all significant associations observed in the exposed group were also observed in negative control analysis (psychotropics discontinued before conception), suggesting that elevated risks could be attributed to unmeasured confounders. Nevertheless, in subclass analyses, certain psychotropic drugs showed increased risks of obstetric complications, i.e. significant associations between atypical antipsychotics and genito-urinary infection (odds ratio 2.70, 95% CI 1.46-4.83), and between valproate and low birth weight (odds ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.16-2.37). These associations became non-significant in negative control analysis, and the high E-values (atypical antipsychotics and genito-urinary infection, 4.84; valproate and low birth weight, 2.75) suggested that the results were unlikely to have been driven by unmeasured confounders. Maternal diagnoses of schizophrenia and depression were independently associated with increased risk of obstetric complications, after controlling for the effects of psychotropics. The population-based data and meticulous analyses did not support any clear causal link between broad-class psychotropic exposure during pregnancy and increased risk of obstetric/neonatal complications. However, some psychotropic subclasses may increase obstetric/neonatal complications. The limited number of episodes involving discontinuation of some psychotropic subclasses may have resulted in false negative findings in the negative control analysis.

We present a case of Achilles tendon swelling and pain related to paratenon effusion. Further ultrasound assessment showed no evidence of acute enthesitis, although a nonspecific degenerative enthesophyte was present. Our case study presents a rare instance of paratenonitis involving effusion into the paratenon lumen. Paratenonitis has a non-specific etiology. Recent findings suggest that paratenonitis plays a role not only in cases of mechanical injury and in patients with spondyloarthritis but also in individuals at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. Further studies have shown that the paratenon surrounding the extensor tendons consists of a lining layer formed by fibroblasts. However, more research is needed to characterize these fibroblasts and compare them to those found in the synovium.

While bioprocesses using Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, various species of Bacillus, lactic acid bacteria, Clostridia, the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, fungi such as Aspergillus niger, and Chinese hamster ovary cells are well established, the high level of microbial diversity has not yet been exploited industrially. However, the use of alternative organisms has the potential to significantly expand the process window of bioprocesses. These extensions include the use of alternative substrates (e.g., CO2, syngas, or methane), unusual process conditions (e.g., temperatures, media conditions), or use of microbial diversity itself (e.g., biofilm growth, alternative electron transport systems, product secretion, surface presentation of enzymes). Bringing these hidden champions into application will enable more efficient processes with environmental and ecological benefits. Some of the most promising alternative microorganisms are described and discussed in detail in this book. The aim of this introductory chapter is to provide an overview of additional organisms and cultivation strategies. Finally, it addresses future challenges to bring the organism into technical applications.

Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, requiring multidisciplinary treatment, including radiotherapy, which is primarily applied in the high-risk group to prevent disease progression. The review highlights indications for radiotherapy, its role in multimodal treatment, and addresses aspects of radiotherapy planning, including target volume definition, prescribed radiation doses, optimal timing for radiotherapy implementation, and potential side effects. Particular attention is drawn to the lack of consensus regarding the necessity of an additional radiation dose for persistent residual disease in the primary tumor and the irradiation of metastatic sites remaining after induction therapy. To conclude, monitoring quality assurance in radiotherapy planning and delivering processes based on unified standards appears to be crucial.

Incontinence-associated dermatitis affects patients admitted to the intensive care unit, especially older adults, physically, mentally, and emotionally. Therefore, nursing activities to prevent and care for incontinence-associated dermatitis are important and necessary for healthcare staff and caregivers. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of a nursing prevention and care program involving the application of Lithospermum Oil on the risk, severity, and incidence rate of incontinence-associated dermatitis among older adult intensive care unit patients. This randomized controlled trial was conducted from July 2023 to October 2023. Sixty-eight samples were recruited by systematic random sampling and equally divided into two groups by simple random sampling. The experimental group received a nursing prevention and care program that involved applying Lithospermum Oil for five days; however, a control group received routine care. After attending the program, the risk level of IAD in the experimental group was no different from that before the application or from the control group. However, after the experiment, the incidence of IAD in the experimental group was significantly lower than in the control group. Finally, the severity of IAD in the experimental group before the experiment did not significantly differ from that after the experiment or from the control group. This study's findings indicate that the intervention effectively reduces the incidence of IAD but does not significantly impact its risk or severity. Nursing prevention and care programs and Lithospermum Oil should be integrated into routine clinical practice to enhance patient care and minimize skin-related complications.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning remains a major forensic and public health concern due to its high lethality and diagnostic challenges. Its colorless, odorless nature and the limited reliability of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels-compounded by postmortem changes-complicate toxicological interpretation. This study employed untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics to characterize systemic biochemical alterations in fatal CO poisoning cases. Integrated metabolomic and lipidomic analyses revealed significant dysregulation in lipid-related pathways, including steroid biosynthesis, mitochondrial β-oxidation, fatty acid and sphingolipid metabolism, and lysophospholipid-mediated membrane destabilization. Impaired biosynthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) was also observed, potentially compromising membrane structure and signaling. These findings highlight widespread metabolic disruption affecting energy homeostasis and lipid signaling. Among the altered metabolites, carnitine 18:2 (CAR 18:2) demonstrated strong discriminative power (AUC = 0.846) between CO-poisoned and control cases, suggesting its value as a forensic biomarker. Additionally, lysophosphatidylcholine 18:2 (LPC 18:2) and sphingomyelin 44:1;O₂ (SM 44:1;O₂) emerged as promising candidates. These results underscore the systemic metabolic impact of CO toxicity and support the continued exploration and implementation of targeted lipidomics as alternative forensic biomarkers in fatal poisonings.

Self-initiated voluntary actions are different from externally triggered or passive movements. However, it remains unclear how these movements affect action feedback processing and how they are prepared. Here, we focus on the sensory and motor-preparatory event-related potentials. Participants made active (self-initiated, 700 ms lower limit), quick (respond to a cue as quickly as possible), and passive (finger moved by device) button presses that triggered visual stimuli. The active and quick conditions elicited lower visual N1-P2 peak-to-peak amplitudes than the passive condition but did not significantly differ from each other. For prestimulus ERPs (lateralized/readiness potential; L/RP), all conditions showed a negative shift in RP, with lower amplitudes in the quick than in the active condition. There were no significant differences between active and passive. For the LRP, the active and quick conditions showed a sharp deflection shortly before the button press. The amplitude of both conditions was significantly lower than passive around 100 ms before the movement. Our results suggest that active and quick movements involve similar feedback prediction, even though they are prepared differently. They thus offer a finer-grained specification of the efference copy mechanism.

Two types of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) proliferation disease are acknowledged so far by the 5th edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumors: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) and mature pDC proliferation associated with myeloid neoplasms (MPDCP) in which pDC is part of the malignant clone. We aim to investigate pDC proliferation associated with non-myeloid acute leukemia (AL). A retrospective analysis of all cases admitted in our center with a diagnosis of non-myeloid AL from September 2020 to April 2023 was performed to select cases with pDCs greater than 2% of bone marrow by flow cytometry (FCM). We conducted comprehensive analyses encompassing FCM immunophenotyping, histopathological examination, morphological assessment, cytogenetic studies, and molecular genetic profiling across all cases. Proliferation of pDCs was detected in 10 (0.88%) out of 1140 non-myeloid AL patients by FCM, including 4/944(0.42%) cases of B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), 3/95 (3.16%) cases of T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and 3/101 (2.97%) cases of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) (p = 0.009). The 4 cases of B-ALL were all Philadelphia Chromosome positive (Ph+). PDCs in 3 out of 10 patients expressed CD56 (37.5%), 8/10 expressed CD7 (80%), 9/10 expressed CD303 (90%), all expressed CD304 (100%), and 5 of 8 evaluable cases were positive for CD34 (62.5%). In cases in which pDCs expressed CD7 and/or CD56, the blast cells all expressed CD7 and/or CD56 as well; the pDCs in all B-ALL patients expressed CD19. FCM dot plot in 2 of the B-ALL-pDC showed a spectrum from blast cells to pDCs: CD303 and CD304 gradually emerged as CD34 disappeared. Among the 8 patients who underwent bone marrow biopsy, pDCs exhibited two distinct distribution patterns: pure interstitial infiltration in 6 cases (75%) and focal/scattered clusters against an interstitial background in 2 cases (25%). NRAS showed recurrent mutations at identical genomic positions. Each NRAS variant (c.35G>A and c.38G>T) was detected twice across three patients. FCM could effectively detect pDC proliferation in non-myeloid leukemia, which occurred at a significantly higher incidence in T-ALL and ALAL than in B-ALL. In B-ALL, it was associated with the Ph + subtype. PDCs and blast cells shared some lymphoid antigens that were uncommon in AML-pDC or BPDCN. In the bone marrow, pDCs were predominantly characterized by an interstitial infiltration pattern.

People with HIV (PWH) are at elevated cardiovascular risk, but existing calculators have suboptimal calibration for this population. The American Heart Association developed new prediction equations (PREVENT) to replace the pooled cohort equations (PCE). PREVENT has not been validated among PWH. Within the Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) cohort, we included individuals aged 40-75 without myocardial infarction or stroke at baseline from 2001 to 2021. We calculated predicted 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk at baseline using the PCE and the PREVENT 10-year ASCVD base equation. Myocardial infarction and stroke were systematically adjudicated. To assess discrimination, we calculated Harrell's C-index and to assess calibration we used the Greenwood-Nam-D'Agostino goodness-of-fit tests. We included 13,135 individuals from 5 sites across the United States. Mean age at enrollment was 44 ± 9 years and 18% were female. Mean predicted 10-year ASCVD risk was 5.8% by PCE and 2.9% by PREVENT. Over 5.7 ± 3.5 years of follow-up, 628 individuals had myocardial infarction or stroke. Discrimination was improved with PREVENT compared to PCE, with Harrell's C-indexes of 0.722 (95% CI 0.701, 0.741) and 0.708 (95% CI 0.687, 0.729), respectively (p = 0.008). Both equations underpredicted risk: the observed-to-expected ratio was 2.69 for PREVENT (p < 0.001) and 1.35 for PCE (p < 0.001). Calibration slopes were 1.998 for PREVENT and 0.932 for PCE, respectively. Among this cohort of PWH, the PREVENT 10-year ASCVD equations were poorly calibrated and underestimated composite risk for myocardial infarction and stroke, with observed risks more than double predicted risks.

To evaluate the quality of care provided to patients with febrile neutropenia (FN) hospitalized at the Depart-ment of Infectious Diseases, Military University Hospital Prague, as a foundation for improving the management of this condition. A retrospective observational analysis of patients diagnosed with the ICD-10 code D70 from 1 January 2015 to 1 June 2023. All evaluated parameters were selected primarily to facilitate the assessment of care quality and compliance with recommended practices. Of 32 evaluated patients, 19 met the criteria for FN. A history of conditions or treatments predisposing to neutropenia was noted in 74 % of patients. Seventy-four percent were admitted following evaluation or referral from an emergency department or another specialist. Blood cultures (at least two sets) were initially obtained in 80 % of cases. Antibiotics were initially administered correctly to all patients. However, considering antibiotic combinations would have been appropriate in 40 % of cases. No patients received antibiotics within one hour of initial contact with a healthcare facility. Antifungals were therapeutically administered to 58% of patients, though 37 % of these had no clear indication. A hematologist was consulted in 75 % of cases, and a stimulating factor (filgrastim) was administered in 88 % of cases. All patients were treated in isolation. An infection source was identified in 74 % of cases. The analysis highlighted areas for improving the quality of care for patients with FN. Based on this study, an internal procedure is now being developed that will focus on coordination with emergency and other departments, emphasize obtaining blood cultures, and ensure the timely and correct administration of antibiotics, including their possible combinations, as well as antifungals.

The concentration of poverty and multidimensional disadvantage has been shown to limit access to health care in these communities. There is a growing interest in using area-level socioeconomic indexes to address the unequal geographic distribution of health care resources. However, the association of area-level socioeconomic indexes with access to primary care-a key area in health policy-has not been determined. To investigate the association of Medicaid primary care utilization with the concentration of poverty and multidimensional disadvantage at the zip code level. This cross-sectional study used the 2019 Transformed-Medicaid Statistical Information System to identify variations in primary care utilization among Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program beneficiaries (age <65 years) by poverty and multidimensional disadvantage levels of their area of residence. Included beneficiaries were enrolled in Medicaid from January 1 to December 31, 2019, and were not dually eligible for Medicare. The zip code-level Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was used to assess the likelihood of a beneficiary having an annual primary care visit, while controlling for individual beneficiary demographic and health characteristics. An activity-based approach was adopted to classify clinicians billing Medicaid for primary care and to identify primary care visits at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). SVI results were compared with results using income-based poverty rates alone. Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2023, through February 28, 2025. Zip code-level deciles of the SVI and poverty rates. Regression analysis was performed at the beneficiary level, using a binary indicator for having a primary care visit on a set of dummy variables for SVI deciles, controlling for age and sex interactions, disability status, and indicators for having been diagnosed with behavioral health or chronic physical health conditions. The total population analyzed comprised 34 890 932 Medicaid beneficiaries (<65 years old; 54.2% female and 45.8% male), more than half of whom resided in the top 20% of socially vulnerable zip codes; approximately 33%, in the top 10%; and another 20%, in the ninth decile. Of the total, 68.1% had at least 1 primary care visit in 2019, at either a non-FQHC practice (61.1%) or a FQHC (12.7%). The probability of having a primary care visit was highest for children (age <18 years) but varied substantially by age. Compared to those residing in the first decile of the SVI (least socially vulnerable), beneficiaries in the tenth decile (most socially vulnerable) were 8.9 (95% CI, -9.9 to -7.9) percentage points (pp) less likely to have a primary care visit when not counting FQHC visits, but this increased to 4.7 (95% CI, -5.5 to -3.8) pp less likely when including FQHC visits. Beneficiaries in the tenth decile were 5.9 (95% CI, 4.9 to 6.8) pp more likely to have a FQHC visit than beneficiaries in the first decile. The SVI results identified more beneficiaries with disparities compared to the area-level poverty rate alone. The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that Medicaid policy should focus on addressing geography-based disparities in access to care using new measures to target resources. The multidimensional SVI is likely a useful tool to identify small geographic areas with barriers to accessing adequate health care. The FQHC findings suggest that substantially increasing investments and support for FQHCs would address geographic inequities in access to health care.

The factors contributing to a poor response to subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are not yet fully understood. Accordingly, predicting the outcome might be challenging particularly in those who display an optimal response to the Levodopa challenge test. To determine which factors may contribute to poor outcome of STN-DBS in PD. We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive PD patients treated with STN-DBS. Motor and non-motor variables were retrieved before surgery and at 1-year follow-up. Patients were divided into poor and good DBS responders by a cut-off value of less than 20% improvement of UPDRS-II in the OFF-medication ON-stimulation condition at 1 year. Thirty-two (26.2%) of 122 patients were categorised as poor responders. Before surgery, poor responders had significantly less impairment in activity of daily living and less severe motor severity. Response to levodopa challenge test was similar between poor and good responders. Significant worsening of axial symptoms at 1-year follow-up in the off-medication off-stimulation condition was found in poor responders. On multivariable linear regression analysis, only the relative change of activity of daily living by dopaminergic medications before surgery predicted its improvement by neurostimulation at 1-year follow-up. Candidates for surgery with less impairment in activities of daily living may have less favourable outcomes after STN-DBS, despite an optimal response during the pre-operative Levodopa challenge. The worsening of axial symptoms due to disease progression might contribute to poorer outcomes, underscoring the need for better identification of these symptoms before surgery.

Few consensus guidelines exist regarding screening mammography recommendations for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals. Our study aimed to assess the utilization of screening mammograms in a large cohort of TGD individuals at a single institution and the factors influencing mammogram uptake. Retrospective cross-sectional study. 800 TGD individuals actively engaged in care at a transgender medicine and surgery urban center. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a database of TGD patients (N = 4052) actively engaged in gender-affirming care in a specialized center for transgender health in a large urban healthcare system. We included all individuals who were age 40 or older at the time of data collection (N = 800) and conducted chart reviews on use of screening mammography and results. Of the 800 TGD individuals over age 40, 532 were recorded male at birth, and 268 were recorded female at birth. Among those aged 50 and above, 136 out of 382 (36%) had a screening mammogram, whereas among those aged 40-49 years old, 72 out of 418 (17%) had a screening mammogram. Twenty-five percent (28/88) of those who underwent chest masculinization surgery had a screening mammogram, while 34.2% (94/275) of those who underwent chest feminizing surgery had a screening mammogram. Twenty-one out of the 208 (10%) of mammograms performed had a BI-RADS category greater than or equal to 3 or greater on diagnostic mammograms. In our single-center large cohort of TGD individuals, we found a low percentage of screening mammography use. In those 50 and above, an age cohort with clear guidelines for screening, only 36% had any screening mammogram, and Hispanic ethnicity, chest masculinizing, and chest feminizing surgery were significant predictors for getting any screening mammograms. Our findings suggest the need for increased compliance with screening guidelines in TGD individuals, consistent with those for cisgender women.

Immunotherapy has become standard of care for numerous cancer types in the past decade. Combining radiotherapy and immunotherapy has the potential to further improve outcomes by taking advantage of their theoretical synergy on antitumoral immune response. Despite promising preclinical and early clinical studies, along with significant improvements reported in specific settings, results from larger trials attempting to expand radioimmunotherapy to diverse clinical scenarios are markedly inconsistent. This review examines published and ongoing clinical trials evaluating this treatment strategy in patients with lung and head and neck cancers, where various sequencing strategies and settings were explored, including the consolidation, concurrent, induction, resectable, and metastatic settings. We highlight similarities and differences between these two tumor sites, discussing factors contributing to the variable efficacy of this therapeutic approach across diverse clinical settings.

"Understanding why Diptera, such as mosquitoes and sand flies, feed on humans is crucial in defining them as vectors of diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus, and leishmaniasis. Determining their attraction to humans (anthropophily) helps in assessing the risk of disease transmission, designing effective vector control strategies, and monitoring the effectiveness of existing control measures. An important question is whether they are specifically attracted to humans in preference to other mammals or whether there is something else at play. In this paper, I propose that the idea that saying species are ""anthropophilic"" when they are preferentially attracted to humans is misleading and that such species are generalists that will opportunistically feed on a wide range of animals including humans when they are available. Other species are specialists that, under rare circumstances, accidently feed on humans. For these groups, I propose the names anthropportunists and anthroaccidentalists, respectively. The level of contact depends on a range of environmental factors and it is these that must be considered in evaluating potential vector importance and management. In this paper, I propose a review of the Leishmania identified in American sand flies and relate them to these two concepts and how it is linked to taxonomic groups, evolution, and ecology. There are records of Leishmania in 91 species, which is only 16.5% of American sand fly species. Of these infections, 56.7% are in the genera Lutzomyia, Nyssomyia, Pintomyia, and Psychodopygus, which are typically generalist anthropportunists. Of the species considered to be proven vectors, 77.4% belong to these four genera. As infections were detected by a variety of methods, further case-by-case field studies are required to evaluate the vectorial role of many of the sand fly species in which Leishmania have been found."

Sequential deposition technique is widely used to fabricate perovskite films with large grain size in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Residual lead halide (PbI2) in the perovskite film tends to be decomposed into metallic lead (Pb0) under long-term heating or light soaking. Here, a chiral levetiracetam (LEV) dopant containing α-amide and pyrrolidone groups is introduced into the PbI2 precursor solution. The carbonyl oxygen (labeled O1) and amide oxygen (labeled O2) in the pyrrolidone ring have significant electronegativity and form coordination bonds with Pb2+ ions through electron transfer, thereby regulating the nucleation and crystallization process of perovskite. The chirality of LEV induces spatial selectivity in perovskite precursor coordination, promoting oriented growth along the (100) crystallographic facet. Additionally, it enables selective defect passivation, preferentially addressing Pb and I vacancies. Ultimately, LEV doping reduces the tripartite residual PbI2 in the perovskite film, including multi-interfaces and bulk. Besides, the resulted PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 26% with a stabilized power output of 25.8% and maintained 90% of its initial PCE after maximum power point tracking for 1000 h. This study offers a novel research paradigm to advance the development of perovskite photovoltaics.

Behçet disease (BD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorder, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 is considered to be the strongest genetic susceptibility factor. The integrated stress response (ISR), defined by the eIF2α/ATF4 axis, is a signaling network that maintains protein homeostasis and regulates innate immunity in eukaryotic cells; pathological activation of this pathway can affect the immune response and cause various diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the ISR signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of BD. The study group comprised 83 BD patients and 33 matched healthy controls. eIF2α, PERK, HRI, HSPB8, and ATF4 mRNA expression analysis was performed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTq-PCR) using cDNA prepared from monocytes isolated from peripheral blood and synovial fluid. HLA-B*51 status was available for 73 BD patients. ISR analysis revealed decreased expression of eIF2α and increased expression of PERK, HRI, HSPB8, and ATF4 genes in BD compared to controls (all p < 0.05). Findings of synovial fluid monocytes of active BD patients with arthritis showed a consistent (p = 0.0417, one-tailed) increase in HSPB8 expression and strong correlation with those in corresponding blood monocytes. BD patients exhibit dysregulated ISR signatures regardless of HLA-B*51 status. Despite limitations in sample size and in vivo validation, our findings implicate these signaling pathways as potential contributors to the pathogenesis of BD and possibly other the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-associated diseases.

Higher lower limb impact load during landing in individuals with patellofemoral pain (PFP) is associated with increased risk of musculoskeletal injuries. This study aimed to investigate differences in landing kinematics, impact load and joint work contribution between individuals with and without PFP, and to identify relationships between kinematics and kinetics variables. Twenty-three PFP patients and nineteen healthy controls performed drop jump tests. Joint angles, peak vertical ground reaction force (PvGRF), average loading rate and joint work contribution were evaluated. Independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the differences between groups. Pearson and Spearman correlations were used to examine relationships between kinematics and kinetics variables. The results demonstrated that the PFP group exhibited significantly greater ankle plantarflexion angle at initial contact, less knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion angles at peak knee flexion angle, greater PvGRF and ankle joint work contribution than the control group (p ≤ 0.045). In the PFP group, no significant associations were found between kinematics and PvGRF (p ≥ 0.059), and the ankle plantarflexion angle at initial contact (r = 0.703) and peak knee flexion angle (r = -0.470) were correlated with ankle joint work contribution. These results suggest individuals with PFP exhibited impaired ability to absorb impact and greater reliance on the ankle for impact absorption. Rehabilitation programs for individuals with PFP should not only focus on the knee joint function but also on optimizing ankle joint motor control, as well as soft-landing techniques and balanced load distribution across the lower limb kinetic chain.

Cell lines serve as invaluable tools in studying lung cancer biology and developing new therapies to combat the disease. However, commercially available cell lines are typically of Caucasian origin and may be less representative of the local genetic background. To address this, our lab previously immortalized cells from pleural fluid of a Filipino non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient via CDK4 transduction. Copy number variations (CNVs) are a type of genetic variation which may affect physiology and disease by disrupting gene function or altering gene expression, and in cancer, these may be associated with patient outcomes. CNV profiling can be valuable for understanding the biology of our immortalized cells and identifying genes that could serve as potential targets for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic interventions. This study aimed to characterize previously immortalized NSCLC-derived cells, GL01, in comparison with an established lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell line, A549, through whole-genome microarray-based copy number profiling. DNA was extracted from GL01 and A549 cells using a commercially-available silica-based DNA extraction kit. DNA extracts were quantified and normalized for microarray analysis. Whole-genome copy number profiling was done using the OncoScan CNV Plus Assay following the manufacturer's protocols, and data was analyzed using the Chromosome Analysis Suite software. Functional analysis of genes identified to be involved in copy number aberrations was done using the PANTHER Classification System. Copy number aberrations span 1,592,737,105 bp in GL01 and 1,715,708,552 bp in A549, with a high degree of concordance between the two. Largescale and focal copy number aberrations previously identified to be recurrent in various LUAD cohorts were present in both GL01 and A549. Focal copy number aberrations associated with previously described lung cancer-related genes involve the PDE4D gene in GL01 and the SKIL and CDKN2A/CDKN2B genes in both GL01 and A549. PANTHER Pathway analysis of genes positively correlated with mRNA expression showed that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway was significantly overrepresented in both GL01 (FDR p = 0.000074) and A549 (FDR p = 0.000075), with 20 genes involved. Additionally, the KRAS:p.G12C/S:c.34G>T/A somatic mutation variant was detected in both GL01 and A549. This study provides a method for identifying potentially clinically-relevant genes associated with a sample's copy number aberrations and the pathways they represent, providing personalized mechanistic, prognostic, and therapeutic insights into the cancer biology of our cells.

Administrative claims data are used in clinical studies; however, recorded diagnoses and procedures have not been fully validated for pediatric patients. We aimed to examine the validity of recorded information on pediatric patients in the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database, a national inpatient database that includes administrative claims data. We validated the DPC data using medical charts as the reference standard. We included patients aged <16 years admitted to a single academic hospital in Tokyo between 2018 and 2022. Positive predictive values were assessed for six diagnoses (cardiac arrest, blood cancer, acute myocarditis, nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and trisomy 21) and in-hospital death. We evaluated intubation, mechanical ventilation, and high-flow nasal cannulas in 100 randomly selected patients from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and pediatric intensive care unit, and the gestational age and birth weight in NICU patients. The positive predictive values of the diagnoses ranged from 70% (non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage) to 100% (trisomy 21 and in-hospital death). The sensitivities of the procedures ranged from 36% (high-flow nasal cannula in the NICU) to 89% (mechanical ventilation in the NICU), and the specificities were all >95%. The mean gestational ages were 34.2 weeks in the chart and 33.8 weeks in the claims, and the mean birth weights were 2101 g in the chart and 2104 g in the claims, demonstrating high concordance. Japanese claims data can be useful for pediatric studies focusing on selected diagnoses, procedures, and birth records with confirmed validity.
40913116	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Platelet factor 4 and stromal cell-derived factor are novel prognostic biomarkers for cerebral vasospasm and mortality after subarachnoid hemorrhage.	Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a life-threatening condition associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, mainly due to post-hemorrhagic complications such as cerebral vasospasm (CVS) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Recent evidence implicates platelet activation and inflammatory mediators in the cascade of secondary injury following aSAH. Monitoring and timely treatment of post-SAH complications is critical to improve clinical outcomes. Current methods of radiological diagnostic for monitoring are laborious and bound to multiple risks, including radiation exposure. Point-of-care blood biomarkers early after SAH are urgently needed to timely detect and treat post-SAH complications. This prospectively designed cohort study aimed to search for novel predictive biomarkers for vasospasm and clinical outcome with overarching goal to improve treatment decision during intensive care treatment. In this prospective study conducted from 2020 to 2022, 63 aSAH patients (16 male and 47 female) were enrolled. Blood samples were collected to measure platelet factor 4 (PF4) and stromal cell derived factor (SDF) levels. To detect vasospasm, computed tomography (CT) perfusions at day 0, 4, 7 and 11 after the SAH was performed and mean transient time (MTT) was quantified as a measure of cerebral perfusion. Clinical outcome was analysed using modified rankin scale (mRS). Clinical and radiological data was recorded prospectively. The association between PF4 levels and CVS was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and logistic regression, while linear regression analyses were performed to examine the correlations of PF4 with mean transit times (MTT) and of SDF with the day of death among non-survivors. Logistic regression revealed that each 1 ng/mL increase in PF4 was associated with a 38% increase in the odds of developing CVS (OR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.07-1.79; p = 0.01). Moreover, elevated PF4 levels were significantly correlated with longer MTT (β = 0.107 per ng/mL; 95% CI: 0.02-0.19; p = 0.02), suggesting impaired cerebral perfusion. Additionally, among non-surviving patients, higher SDF levels were significantly associated with a later occurrence of death (β = 0.01 per pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.001-0.019; p = 0.03). The findings indicate that PF4 and SDF are promising biomarkers in aSAH. Elevated PF4 levels are associated with an increased risk of CVS and impaired cerebral perfusion, while higher SDF levels correlate with mortality. These biomarkers may offer valuable insights for early risk stratification and pave the way for targeted therapeutic interventions in patients with aSAH.
40691775	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Artificial Intelligence in Pediatric Nursing Care: A Bibliometric and Visualization Analysis of the Literature (2000-2024).	This bibliometric analysis investigates the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence in pediatric nursing care, leveraging bibliometric techniques and visualization to analyze 317 publications indexed in Web of Science (2000-2024). We conducted citation and co-occurrence analyses of keywords, utilizing VOSviewer to map the scientific knowledge base. Results indicate an exponential growth trajectory in publications and citation impact, particularly post-2019, with the United States as the leading contributor. Thematic analysis reveals a distinct focus on symptom management, emotional support, and family-centered care within pediatric artificial intelligence nursing research, diverging from the predominantly disease-centric focus in general medical artificial intelligence literature. Five key thematic clusters emerged: (1) clinical and disease-focused pediatric nursing, (2) technology and innovation in nursing education and practice, (3) pain and psychological well-being in pediatric surgical patients, (4) adolescent mental health and COVID-19's impact, and (5) family-centered care and holistic pediatric nursing. This study underscores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence to augment pediatric nursing practice, enabling personalized and holistic care. These findings provide crucial insights for nursing informatics specialists, researchers, and clinicians to guide future research, address ethical implications, and develop evidence-based implementation strategies for integrating artificial intelligence into pediatric care.

"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) play a pivotal role in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, the biomarkers used to predict ICI efficacy are limited due to their reliance on single or static tumor characteristics. This study aims to develop a machine learning (ML) model that incorporates dynamic changes in clinlabomics data to optimize the predictive accuracy of ICI efficacy. This multicenter, retrospective study utilized nine ML to construct the model. Participants were further stratified into low-risk and high-risk groups based on the predicted efficacy of ICI. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and RNA-sequencing were used for differential analysis. This study enrolled 377 patients with advanced GC who underwent first-line ICI treatment across eleven hospitals between January 2018 and May 2023. Among them, 220 patients from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University were selected for the development model. The remaining ten hospitals contributed to two external test cohorts. Ten dynamic clinlabomics features were identified. The XGBoost demonstrated optimal performance in predicting ICI response, achieving an AUC of 0.863 in the training cohort, and 0.790-0.842 in the validation and two external cohorts. Notably, the model exhibited strong predictive capabilities compared to single point-in-time and previously proposed model. In the subgroup analysis, the low-risk subtype demonstrated a significantly improved prognosis and exhibited characteristics of ""hot tumors"". A web tool was generated: https://ici-therapeutic-efficacy-predictor-ztwwfwek2uckbmhxlnsayq.streamlit.app/ . The dynamic clinlabomics model can effectively predict the ICI efficacy in advanced GC. The model was validated using multicenter data and provides new evidence to optimize treatment decisions."

Treatment of patients with severe hemophilia A requires the replacement of deficient factor VIII. To reach the international standards of care, an optimal dose of factor VIII should be administered based on pharmacokinetic analysis. However, in Mexico factor VIII pharmacokinetics is not used. Therefore, this study aimed to determine, for the first time, the pharmacokinetic parameters of factor VIII in Mexican patients with severe hemophilia A. Fifteen samples from patients with severe hemophilia A under prophylactic treatment were analyzed. Factor VIII activity was determined before infusion at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12, and 48 h after infusion of a standardized dose of factor VIII (40 UI/kg). WinNolin software was used to establish a mono- and bi-compartmental models to obtain the following parameters: area under the curve, maximum activity, in vivo recovery, distribution volume, half-life time, mean residence time, clearance, minimum activity, and elimination constant. Factor VIII pharmacokinetics was highly variable among our patients who frequently received overdosage of factor VIII. The bi-compartmental model better explained the behavior of factor VIII in patients with hemophilia A. Compared with the regimens based on body weight, factor VIII pharmacokinetics shows that the response to factor VIII treatment differs greatly among our patients. Our results strongly suggest that factor VIII treatment must be personalized, regardless of body weight. The lack of evidence and experience on factor VIII pharmacokinetics in our country may represent an obstacle to the future use of extended half-life recombinant factor VIII products.

Neuroimmune processes are often implicated in young people with atypical neuropsychiatric disorders, yet treatment implications remain controversial. This case series details young people with primary psychiatric disorders who received adjunctive immunotherapy after thorough investigation and extensive conventional treatments. We evaluated 45 individuals (93% female, ages 12-30 years) with atypical psychiatric presentations suggesting potential neuroimmune involvement. Participants underwent clinical phenotyping, laboratory investigation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, neuroimaging, and/or electroencephalography. We tracked outcomes after personalized immunotherapy through global clinical improvement (Clinical Global Impressions-Global Improvement) and changes in social-occupational functioning (Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale [SOFAS]), education/employment status (not in education, employment, or training [NEET]), psychiatric hospitalization, and medication use. Treatment response was assessed post-intervention, at 6 to 12 months, and at a long-term follow-up (78.2 ± 31.3 months). Participants presented with severe depression (80%), psychotic features (56%), treatment resistance (82%), and/or neurological symptoms (96%). Illness duration before immunotherapy was often prolonged (mean = 4.8 ± 4.7 years, median = 3 years). Autoantibodies were detected in serum or CSF in 64% of participants, while 91% showed elevated inflammatory markers. Of 43 individuals receiving immunotherapy, 88% experienced clinical improvement posttreatment, with 79% maintaining long-term benefits. Functional outcomes improved significantly: SOFAS scores increased from 43.2 ± 11.8 to 69.2 ± 9.8, while NEET rates declined from 81% to 14%. Psychiatric hospitalization dropped from 93% to 7%, and psychotropic medication use decreased from 84% to 9%. Earlier treatment predicted better outcomes (p = .025). Adverse effects occurred in 79% of participants, with 21% experiencing moderate-to-severe complications. These findings suggest the importance of early identification and specialist assessment of atypical psychiatric presentations in young people. New guidelines need to support appropriate screening, personalized management, and long-term treatment and monitoring protocols.

Cancer diagnoses are increasing in Sub-Saharan Africa. Diagnoses often occur at a late stage in the disease, hampering the timely initiation of palliative care. The lack of formalised palliative care provision in the region results in informal caregivers assuming most of the caregiving roles for patients. This has considerable implications for informal caregivers. This meta-synthesis seeks to explore how informal caregivers of persons living with advanced cancer have experienced palliative care provision in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study was guided by Hannes' framework of meta-synthesis. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Global Health, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Africa Index Medicus databases was conducted. Two authors independently performed the screening and extraction processes. Thematic synthesis guided the analysis and synthesis. Fifteen studies were retained in the study. The synthesis yielded eight analytical themes: motivations for caregiving, roles of informal caregivers, challenges and barriers of informal caregiving, quality of informal caregiving, burden and price of informal caregiving, coping strategies of informal caregivers, recommendations for improving caregiving, and the paradox of end-of-life preparation and advanced planning. In Sub-Saharan Africa, informal caregivers provide the backbone of palliative care, often without preparation, resources, or formal support. Their roles are shaped by cultural expectations of family duty but constrained by poverty and limited health infrastructure. Strengthening caregiver training and integrating their contributions into developing formal palliative care systems are essential to improve outcomes for patients and families.
40882210	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	An Enhanced Social Network Strategy to Increase the Uptake of HIV Services: Protocol for Type I Hybrid Implementation Study (Carolinas RESPOND).	In the United States, persisting new HIV diagnoses among gay, bisexual, and other cisgender men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and transgender women make it unlikely that the United States will meet the Ending the HIV Epidemic's (EHE) goal to reduce new HIV diagnoses by 90% by 2030. Innovative strategies are needed to address this challenge, particularly in the US South, where Black and Latinx GBMSM and transgender women are disproportionately impacted by HIV. Social network approaches have led to increased HIV testing uptake. Social network interventions that are responsive to individuals' needs among disproportionately impacted groups could also increase engagement across the HIV prevention and care continuum. This hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study will evaluate an enhanced social network strategy (eSNS) intervention designed to increase engagement in HIV services (HIV testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] use, and HIV care) by groups disproportionately affected by HIV. From 2025 to 2027, eSNS will be delivered in the Charlotte, North Carolina (NC) region, which includes Mecklenburg County, a priority EHE jurisdiction. The study's phase 1 was a formative period of mixed methods data collection to operationalize enhancements to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's social network strategy (SNS). In Phase 2, the intervention will be integrated into standard NC Partner Services for people diagnosed with HIV and their sexual or social contacts, which is routinely performed by disease intervention specialists (DISs). We will identify network recruiters (ambassadors) who are 18 years and older and are either reached by study team DIS (DIS coaches) performing partner services or referred at community sites. Over 2-6 weeks, DIS coaches will guide ambassadors to identify and refer people in their network (peers) for HIV services and will facilitate peers' referrals to HIV services. Finally, Phase 3 will evaluate the eSNS's effectiveness in increasing HIV services uptake compared to standard-of-care partner services in the Raleigh, NC region. This project was funded by the National Institutes of Health and initially approved by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Institutional Review Board in 2022. Phase 1 concluded in August 2024. Implementation of eSNS (Phase 2) was launched in March 2025. Based on phase 1 findings, the study was modified to include Ambassadors of any race or ethnicity and gender (originally only Black GBMSM and transgender women) and expand identification of ambassadors through community sites (in addition to partner services). Substantial reductions in new HIV diagnoses depend on public health approaches that effectively reach people with a higher likelihood of acquiring HIV. Our protocol proposes integrating existing strategies with an innovative intervention (eSNS) to reduce social barriers to disproportionately affected groups' engagement in the full HIV prevention and care continuum.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with end-stage renal failure on renal replacement therapy are at high risk of stroke and bleeding, but the optimal oral anticoagulation (OAC) strategy is uncertain. To investigate the most effective OAC therapy for patients with AF on long-term dialysis. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were systematically searched from inception to 9 October 2024 to identify relevant studies on OAC strategy for patients with AF on long-term dialysis. The effectiveness outcomes were ischaemic stroke and/or systemic thromboembolism, all-cause mortality and the safety endpoint was major bleeding. The present study encompassed a comprehensive analysis of 33 studies involving a total of 137,574 patients with AF on long-term dialysis. All OACs, including warfarin (hazard ratio [HR], .963; 95% confidence interval [CI], .841-1.104), did not show a statistically significant decrease in the risk of ischaemic stroke and/or systemic thromboembolism compared to no anticoagulant therapy. Only apixaban 5 mg twice daily was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to non-OAC use (HR, .671; 95% CI, .490-.919). Dabigatran (HR, 2.140; 95% CI, 1.734-2.642) and phenprocoumon (HR, 2.419; 95% CI, 1.241-4.713) were associated with a significantly higher risk of major bleeding than non-OAC use. All OACs were not associated with a reduced risk of ischaemic stroke and/or systemic thromboembolism in patients with AF on long-term dialysis. Only apixaban 5 mg twice daily was associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality when compared with non-OAC use.

Our review aimed to determine the prevalence of - and factors associated with - hearing loss, oral and olfactory disease, frozen shoulder, trigger finger, and hair loss in young adults with type 1 diabetes. These conditions were selected based on research team interests, existing literature, and group discussion. We conducted a quantitative narrative review using a systematic process to identify cohort and cross-sectional studies involving young adults with type 1 diabetes (mean age 18-30 years). PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane were searched (January 2000-February 2024). Grey literature was not restricted, and quality appraisal was undertaken. Extracted data were synthesised and summarised narratively. The initial search found 3924 records and after title, abstract and full-text review, 19 records met inclusion criteria. Hearing loss prevalence ranged from 22.6 to 48.0 %, with age, diabetes duration, and systolic blood pressure identified as prominent associated features. For oral disease, peridontitis prevalence was 4.7 %, while alveolar bone loss ranged from 24.6 to 43.9 %; age was the primary associated factor. No eligible data were identified regarding frozen shoulder, trigger finger, or hair loss. Further research is needed to characterize the prevalence and risk factors of atypical complications in type 1 diabetes. Clinical care should be guided by a robust understanding of these under-recognised comorbidities.

Efgartigimod (EFG) is usually used to treat generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) with long disease duration; the benefit in new-onset gMG remained unknown. This study included 87 new-onset gMG patients who received either oral steroid and immunosuppressive treatment (Conventional group, n = 30) or combined with EFG (EFG group, n = 57). The primary outcome was minimal symptom expression (MSE) responders, as denoted by a Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) of 0 or 1 for over 4 weeks. At 12 weeks, the proportion of MSE responders was significantly higher in the EFG group (45.61 %, 26/57 vs. 13.33 %, 4/30, p = 0.0026). With the EFG group, patients with late-onset gMG had greater reductions in MG-ADL than those associated with thymoma (7.06 ± 3.25 vs. 4.96 ± 3.40, p = 0.040). EFG may be a promising treatment for rapid disease control in new-onset gMG, but future studies are still required to assess the cost-effectiveness and long-term safety.

The treatment of non-segmental vitiligo (NSV) remains challenging and poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate protein differences in lesional and non-lesional skin and changes of cellular and proteomic markers early in treatment in lesional skin and blood in relation to clinical response. This prospective exploratory study was conducted in 30 NSV patients, 11 starting with standard-of-care topical therapy and 19 in combination with narrowband (NB)-UVB phototherapy. We identified 53 proteins that differed between blister fluid from lesional and non-lesional skin, before treatment. After 3-months therapy, CD3+, CD8+ T and TRM (CD69+CD103-) cell populations decreased in skin biopsies, together with changes in 47 blisterfluid proteins. Percentages of cTfh17, CD336+Nkbright, type-1-regulatory T (Tr1) and Interleukin-10-secreting Tr1 cells decreased in blood. Decrease in TRM, Tr1 and Interleukin-10-secreting Tr1, and Fatty Acid-Binding Protein-4 (FABP4), were associated with repigmentation, measured by Vitiligo Extent Score at baseline and 6-months. Differences in lesional and non-lesional skin prior to treatment, do not reflect changes in lesional skin early in therapy nor associations with clinical repigmentation response. We found an association between decreasing FABP4 and TRM cells in skin and IL10 secreting Tr1 cells in blood and repigmentation response to treatment of vitiligo.

To analyze the development of infectious complications from civilian gunshot wounds to the spine and their association with the type of prophylactic antibiotics administered and the duration of administration. Despite the risk for infections following spinal gunshot wounds, no standardized guidelines exist for their management. The limited and low-quality evidence available underscores the need for further research. This retrospective cohort study evaluated adult civilian patients (≥18 years) treated for spinal gunshot wounds at Latin American institutions between 2014 and 2022. Demographic, clinical, and injury characteristics, treatment approaches, and infectious complications were analyzed. After exclusions, 292 patients, primarily adult males (n=251, 86.0%) with a mean age of 32.6 years (standard deviation=11), were included. Most injuries affected the thoracic (n=135; 46.2%) and lumbosacral (n=95; 32.5%) spine. Infectious complications occurred in 20 patients (6.8%), including spinal infections (n=3; 1.0%), non-spinal infections (n=6; 2.1%), and wound infections (n=11; 3.8%). Most patients received prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis. The median duration of antibiotic administration was significantly increased in patients with dirty wounds (p<0.001) and high-velocity injuries (p=0.001). However, the duration of antibiotic administration did not influence spinal infection rates. Our findings indicate a low incidence (1%) of spinal infections among patients with spinal gunshot wounds. Prolonged antibiotic use failed to reduce the risk of spinal infectious complications. Standardized guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis in these injuries remain necessary to optimize care.

Pillar pain and scar-related discomfort are common complications following open carpal tunnel release (CTR). While surgical approaches have been widely studied, the influence of skin closure techniques on postoperative pillar pain remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the effect of two different skin closure methods, subcuticular absorbable monocryl sutures versus interrupted non-absorbable nylon sutures, on postoperative pillar pain and scar quality. In this randomized controlled trial, 128 patients who underwent open carpal tunnel release by a single surgeon were randomly assigned to one of the two groups using a computer-generated randomization sequence. Group 1 received subcuticular monocryl closure, while Group 2 received interrupted nylon sutures. Patients were evaluated at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pillar pain and the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) for scar evaluation. Patients in the monocryl group reported significantly lower VAS scores for pillar pain at 6 weeks (P < 0.05), with differences narrowing by week 12. POSAS scores also favored monocryl at early follow-up, particularly in parameters such as itching and stiffness. No major complications were observed in either group. Skin closure techniques may significantly affect early postoperative outcomes in CTR. Subcuticular monocryl sutures were associated with reduced pillar pain and improved scar quality in the early recovery phase, suggesting their potential advantage over conventional nylon sutures.

"This study aims to investigate the current status of disability among older adults and analyze factors influencing the burden on their family caregivers in southern China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 334 pairs of disabled older adults (≥65 years) and their primary family caregivers across three districts in Guangzhou. Face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires assessed disability levels via the ""Long-term Care Disability Level Assessment"" scale and caregiver burden via the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) scale. For ordinal variables, the Kruskal-Wallis H test was applied for multi-group comparisons, while the Mann-Whitney U test was used for two-group analyses. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Ordinal logistic regression identified factors associated with caregiver burden. Among 334 disabled older adults in Guangzhou, the mean age was 82 years. Of these, 55.7% were married, 43.4% were male, 43.4% had an educational attainment of primary school or below. For the 334 family caregivers, 62.3% were female, 36.8% had completed high school or vocational education. The median years of caregiving experience was 5 years, with a median weekly caregiving time of 70 h. Caregiver burden distribution was as follows: 16.2% no burden, 41.0% mild burden, 28.7% moderate burden, and 14.1% severe burden. Statistically significant differences in caregiver burden were observed across the following variables (p < 0.05): disabled old adults' activities of daily living (ADL), caregivers' gender, child in school, physical disease, years of caregiving experience, weekly caregiving time, social interaction frequency, life satisfaction, and social support network size. Higher caregiver life satisfaction and elevated ADL scores in care recipients emerged as protective factors. Conversely, longer weekly caregiving hours and caregivers' physical illness were identified as risk factors. This study identifies weekly caregiving time, caregivers' physical disease, disabled older adults' ADL capacity, and caregivers' life satisfaction as critical determinants of burden severity in aging China, advocating multilevel interventions."

VH3810109 (N6LS) is a CD4-binding site antibody with broad and potent neutralizing activity in vitro. Here, we present efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic results from the phase 2a BANNER study in people with HIV-1. BANNER was a randomized, open-label, 2-part, multicenter study of N6LS in adults naive to antiretroviral therapy (ART) with HIV-1 RNA ≥5000 copies/mL. N6LS was evaluated during monotherapy after a single intravenous (IV) infusion at various doses or subcutaneous (SC) injection, followed by 48 weeks of standard-of-care ART. Antiviral activity, safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were evaluated. Sixty-two participants completed the monotherapy phase and 58 completed the standard-of-care phase. Most participants were male (94%), Hispanic (82%), and White (61%). Virologic response (reduction in HIV-1 RNA ≥0.5 log10 copies/mL from baseline) was achieved in 8/8 (100%; 40 mg/kg IV), 14/15 (93%; 700 mg IV), 5/6 (83%; 280 mg IV), 7/16 (44%; 70 mg IV), and 8/16 (50%; 700 mg SC) participants. Administered IV or SC, N6LS was well tolerated with few drug-related adverse events (n=13) and no serious adverse events reported during monotherapy. Pharmacokinetic parameters increased proportionally with dose. Incidence of ADAs was dose-dependent and ranged from 6% to 83% in the IV groups; incidence was 19% in the SC group, with no indication that route of administration impacts incidence of ADAs. N6LS was efficacious and generally safe, supporting further development of N6LS dosed IV or SC for the treatment of HIV-1 (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04871113).

Canine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a powerful technology that can be used to clone beloved companion dogs, produce valuable working dogs, rescue endangered canine breeds, and create genetically engineered dogs. Nevertheless, the application of this technology is hindered by the low developmental efficiency of canine SCNT embryos. It has been shown that in pig and horse cloning using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), compared with fibroblasts, as donor cells can enhance the developmental potential of SCNT embryos. Whether this is also true for dog SCNT is unknown. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of MSCs and fibroblasts as donor cells for canine SCNT. We demonstrated that canine adipose tissue-derived MSCs (cAd-MSCs) have a higher growth rate, lower apoptosis level, and higher expression level of pluripotency genes and HOX family genes than canine ear fibroblasts (cEFs). These features enhance the reprogramming efficiency of cAd-MSCs in canine-porcine interspecies SCNT (iSCNT) embryos, resulting in a higher developmental competence in cAd-MSCs-derived iSCNT embryos than that in cEFs-generated counterparts. This study indicates that cAd-MSC is a better donor cell type than cEF for SCNT.

Reconstructing multi-tissue defects in the finger remains a significant challenge in hand surgery. We present the case of a 37-year-old man with segmental loss of bone, skin and extensor apparatus on the dorsal aspect of the index finger. A single stage reconstruction was successfully performed using a pedicled chimeric flap based on the second dorsal metacarpal artery combining skin paddle, second metacarpal base bone and the extensor indicis proprius. At 12 weeks, proximal interphalangeal joint fusion was achieved and the skin flap healed uneventfully. The patient regained full extension and 20° of active flexion at the distal interphalangeal joint. To our knowledge, this specific chimeric flap has not been previously described in the literature. This technique provides a versatile, single-stage solution for complex dorsal finger reconstruction, minimizing morbidity and optimizing functional outcomes.

The separation and propagation of spin are vital to understanding spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in quantum systems. Exciton-polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasiparticles, offer a promising platform for investigating SOC in quantum fluids. By utilization of the optical anisotropy of materials, Rashba-Dresselhaus SOC (RDSOC) can be generated, enabling robust polariton spin transport. However, the intrinsic connection between the RDSOC and polariton spin evolution lacks an intuitive interpretation. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature exciton-polaritons with RDSOC in a microcavity containing anisotropic two-dimensional hybrid perovskites. We reveal that the RDSOC arises from geometric phase accumulation during polariton polarization evolution on the Poincaré sphere, which generates an effective gauge field and drives momentum-space spin splitting. By resonantly injecting polaritons, we achieve the generation, separation, and propagation of purer polariton spin states, i.e., a polariton spin Hall effect. Our findings establish geometric phases as the origin of intrinsic RDSOC, paving a feasible avenue for spin-selective control in perovskite-based photonic devices.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common mental health condition encountered in primary care settings. GAD screening, diagnosis, and management are challenging, among other issues that capture the attention of primary care physicians (PCPs). Measurement-based care (MBC) involves the systematic assessment of patients' symptoms and treatment progress using standardized tools. Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) is a well-known screening and symptom-monitoring tool for GAD. It quantifies subjective symptoms objectively by measuring the patient's anxiety level. We aimed to increase utilization of GAD-7 in outpatient clinics to improve diagnosis and management of GAD through educational interventions and by educating PCPs to access the GAD-7 tool in the EPIC electronic medical record (EMR) with ease. This study employed a quasi-experimental interrupted time series design over 12 months. The intervention involved displaying posters educating family physicians on accessing GAD-7 screening tools in EMR and using smart phrases to document GAD-7 results in two outpatient family medicine clinics. SlicerDicer measured total anxiety encounters and GAD-7 utilization 3 months before and 9 months after intervention. Statistical process control was used, and control charts were created using the statistical software JMP Pro-16. A Poisson regression model was used to detect statistically significant differences using statistical software SAS 9.4. GAD-7 utilization increased from 4.5 in the preintervention period to 20.5 in the postintervention period. There was a significant increase in GAD-7 utilization over time after implementing our QI intervention. The control chart phase analysis showed a shift in the process with an increase in the average rate of GAD-7 utilization from 11.5 per 100 encounters per week in the preintervention phase to an average of 35.8 per 100 encounters per week postintervention phase. The effect was sustained over a year postintervention. The Poisson regression model also showed a 21% increase (p < 0.0001) in the incidence rate ratio in the post-intervention period as compared with the preintervention. Utilization of GAD-7 as an application of MBC improved with the implementation of a bundled intervention using quality improvement tools. Other programs may replicate this in their similar quality improvement endeavors.

The original scale was developed/validated with Japanese cancer patients. It was our aim to report the psychometric properties of an English translation of the CFS. This cross-sectional study was conducted between February-October 2008 in London, UK. Three groups were recruited: cancer patients (index group), diabetic patients (chronic disease control group), and a healthy control group. All participants completed a questionnaire on recruitment and a subset were retested at 2-8 weeks. Reliability was assessed with analysis of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), homogeneity (item-total correlations) and test-retest reliability. Construct validity was assessed with inter-subscale correlations. To assess convergent validity, the correlations between the CFS and FNS, EORTC - QLQ C30, and HADS were examined with Spearman Rank correlation coefficients. The discriminant validity was determined by the known group method. 160 participants were recruited: 60 cancer and 50 diabetes patients, and 50 healthy patients. Cronbach's alphas for the total scale and all three subscales (range 0.83,0.94) were all above the 0.70 criterion suggested for group comparisons thus the CFS showed excellent internal consistency. Homogeneity measures all fulfilled the 0.20 criterion (range 0.53-0.84). Combining the three groups, all test-retest correlations for the CFS and its subscales were above 0.7. Physical and affective subscales showed 100% scaling success. Both scores and sub-scores for the CFS correlated positively (p < 0.001) with FNS and HADS depression and anxiety subscales. The CFS correlated positively (p < 0.001) with all but one item of the EORTC-QLQ C30. This evaluation of the measurement properties of the CFS-English shows that it is a reliable and valid tool for assessing key dimensions of cancer-related fatigue.

A telemedicine pilot project has received temporary authorization in Korea. The clinical effectiveness of telemedicine is well established; however, ongoing research must assess medical utilization, sustainability, prescription continuity, and safety. This study evaluated medical utilization, sustainability, prescription continuity, and safety before and after the implementation of a telemedicine pilot project between June 2022 and December 2023. Data were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), and participants were divided into those who received non-face-to-face hypertension treatment at least once and those who did not. This study included 124,210 patients diagnosed with hypertension who received telemedicine (the Tele_G group) and 124,210 propensity score-matched control individuals. The difference-in-difference (DID) for medical utilization between the Tele_G and control groups was 0.10 (-0.03 vs. -0.12, p<0.001). The DID for the Modified Modified Continuity Index was -0.005 (-0.003 vs. 0.002, p<0.001), while that for Most Frequent Provider Continuity was -0.006 (-0.004 vs. 0.002, p<0.001). The DID for the prescription day rate was 0.41 (-0.61 vs. -1.02, p<0.001), and that for the appropriate prescription continuation rate was 0.52 (-1.23 vs. -1.75, p<0.005). Telemedicine did not fully achieve the same standard as face-to-face treatment for hypertension management; however, it showed comparable safety, suggesting potential as secondary care. As the first NHIS-based study on this topic in Korea, this research highlights the benefits of telemedicine when appropriately utilized for patients with hypertension. Nevertheless, due to limitations regarding long-term continuity and policy design, cautious interpretation is required, and further prospective studies are warranted.

Climate change threatens biodiversity, water, food and human health and well-being. Rapid, sustained mitigation and adaptation actions can benefit all these elements of the nexus. Key transitions in energy, land and marine ecosystems, urban areas, industry and society are essential for climate change mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development. These transitions require interdisciplinary research, policy support and societal engagement. Here we present an assessment of 69 response options, a subset of which (15) was used in the climate change chapter of the IPBES Nexus Assessment. We show that the majority of climate change response options for land, oceans and ecosystems, settlement and infrastructure, industrial and societal system transitions have broadly positive impacts across the nexus. However, energy system transitions show more apparent trade-offs. Most of these impacts result from energy infrastructure that would also be required for fossil fuel-based systems and should be compared to the far more damaging consequences of continued fossil fuel use. Transitioning to cleaner, renewable energy sources reduces these risks and offers significant improvements across the nexus by reducing climate change impacts. Of the 69 response options assessed, 59% have entirely positive effects, or at least no negative effects, across all nexus elements and can be considered as low-risk, immediately actionable options. The remaining 41% show either negative or variable impacts on at least one nexus element. However, this does not render them unviable; rather, their implementation must be carefully managed. Where impacts are variable, strategies should be tailored to ensure positive outcomes; where trade-offs are unavoidable, efforts should focus on minimising negative effects and maximising synergies. Our findings suggest that prioritising policies that address the interconnected challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, pollution, food insecurity, access to clean water, energy for all and sustainable development will deliver more effective and equitable climate action.

Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease. Following Beijing's implementation of a three-dose MMR vaccination strategy, incidence rates declined significantly. However, the current 21-d quarantine period lacks evidence-based support, resulting in low compliance and conflicts between healthcare providers and patients. This study analyzed 2019-2024 surveillance data to characterize mumps in the vaccine era through viral shedding detection. Study participants were NNDRS-reported mumps cases with both registered and collective residences in Beijing's Chaoyang District, who signed informed consent for shortened isolation surveillance. Data were integrated from three sources: 1) National Notifiable Disease Reporting System cases; 2) Beijing's immunization registry; and 3) epidemiological/laboratory records. PCR and/or serology-confirmed cases (Chaoyang CDC) were analyzed for demographics, clinical features, and vaccination history. Quarantine clearance was based on test results. From 2005 to 2024, 8,070 mumps cases were reported in Chaoyang District (average annual incidence: 12.69/100,000), showing a downward trend. Among 146 cases (2019-2024), 95.89% were childcare/school attendees; 141 received ≥1 MMR dose. All cases presented parotid swelling (duration: 1-12 d, 97.26% ≤9 d), with no complications. Of the 526 samples, 4 tested PCR-positive, 6 IgM-positive, and 18 IgG-confirmed. Quarantine was safely reduced from 21 to 9 d in 88.36% (129/146) of cases without increasing outbreak risks. The 21-d quarantine standard is outdated due to evolving epidemiological patterns. Recommendations include adopting molecular diagnostic criteria, validating a ≤5-d quarantine via multicenter studies, and establishing dynamic vaccine efficacy monitoring for targeted prevention.

Plasma metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables detection of microbial cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (mcfDNA) in blood without the need for culture or organism-specific primers. Here, we review clinical performance, methodological variability, and real-world application of plasma mNGS for infectious disease diagnosis in immunocompromised hosts (ICHs). Plasma mNGS has rapidly gained attention as a novel diagnostic tool for infections in ICHs, offering broad-range pathogen detection from a noninvasive blood sample. A growing number of observational studies have assessed its diagnostic yield, clinical impact, and potential to reduce invasive procedures or time to diagnosis. However, results remain variable, with significant differences in study design, patient populations, and adjudication methods. While some studies report meaningful added value, others highlight challenges related to clinical interpretation, limited standardization, and uncertain cost-effectiveness. Moreover, although mNGS offers a wide organismal scope, its sensitivity is influenced by pathogen type, immune status, and technical limitations - particularly in fungal infections and low-burden diseases. Overall, mNGS has yet to find a clearly defined role in routine diagnostic workflows. Understanding the current evidence, limitations, and variability surrounding plasma mNGS is essential to guide its appropriate clinical use and to inform future integration into diagnostic pathways for ICHs.

Epitranscriptomic modifications regulate gene expression and have been implicated in cancer, including breast cancer. Using the SCAN-B cohort, we analyzed 49 messenger RNA modification regulators (mRMPs) across breast cancer subtypes. In the basal subtype, we found significant overexpression of m6A readers (IGF2BP1-3), m5C regulators (NSUN5, ALYREF, YBX1, YBX2), pseudouridine [PUS1, MARS (or MetRS), RPUSD2], and RNA editing enzymes [APOBEC3A (A3A), A3G, ADAR1], all linked to poor survival. Conversely, the m6A writer METTL14 was downregulated. Our findings highlight key mRMPs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, underscoring the role of RNA modifications in breast cancer progression.

Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) requires long-term antiviral therapy, but its broader effects on metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes remain underexplored. This nationwide retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of antiviral therapy on dyslipidemia and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in CHB patients. Using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database, we identified 441 191 patients, of whom 48 606 received antiviral treatment and were matched 1:1 with untreated controls by propensity score. Antiviral therapy was associated with significantly lower incidence rates of both dyslipidemia (14.63 vs. 18.20 per 100 000 person-years; IRR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.76-0.85) and MACE (2.15 vs. 3.08 per 100 000 person-years; IRR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.91). Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) showed the strongest protective effects against both outcomes, with adjusted hazard ratios of 0.52 for dyslipidemia and 0.58 for MACE. Stratified analysis revealed that the protective effects of antiviral therapy against dyslipidemia and MACE were primarily observed in nondiabetic patients, while only a nonsignificant trend toward risk reduction was noted in diabetic patients. These findings suggest that antiviral therapy, particularly TDF, provides extrahepatic benefits, supporting its role in the long-term management of CHB beyond virologic suppression.
40920507	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Cross-category attentional biases driven by visual mental imagery of social cues.	In cluttered and complex natural scenes, selective attention enables the visual system to prioritize relevant information. This process is guided not only by perceptual cues but also by imagined ones. The current research extends the imagery-induced attentional bias to the unconscious level and reveals its cross-category applicability between different social cues (e.g., eye gaze and biological motion). Using a visual imagery task combined with an attentional bias paradigm, we showed that imagining a gaze cue biased selective attention toward the imagery-matching eye gaze. Removing the imagery task obliterated the attentional effect, emphasizing the pivotal role of mental imagery in driving the observed results. Furthermore, the attentional bias persisted even when the physically presented eye gazes were rendered invisible, suggesting the automaticity of the effect and a dissociation between attention and consciousness. When the imagery content involved biological motion cues, cross-categorical attentional bias toward imagery-matching eye gaze was evident. However, this cross-categorical effect did not extend to nonsocial arrow cues-imagining an arrow cue failed to bias attention toward imagery-matching eye gaze, though arrow cues induced within-categorical attentional biases for imagery-matching arrows. These findings point to the existence of shared mechanisms dedicated to processing different social cues rather than nonsocial cues. Taken together, the present study highlights a novel mechanism through which social cue-based imagery guides spatial attention, which operates independently of visual awareness and is supported by a dedicated social module, shedding light on the intricate interplay between the internal mental representations and the external physical world.

40919507	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Association between mental work and biological aging: the mediating role of visceral adiposity index.	This study aimed to investigate the relationship between mental work, work intensity, and accelerated biological aging, focusing on the mediating role of the Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI). In this cross-sectional study, data were collected from the Kailuan physical activity cohorts in the Asia-Pacific region. Biological aging was assessed using PhenoAge and Klemera-Doubal method age (KDMAge) acceleration. Multivariable linear regression models examined the link between mental work and biological aging, while mediation analysis assessed the role of VAI. Among 3,933 participants (mean age 56.4 years; 55.6% male), mental workers showed greater biological age (BA) acceleration: KDMAge acceleration increased by 1.52 years (p for trend = .04) and PhenoAge by 1.46 years (p for trend < .001) compared to manual workers, after adjusting for age and sex. In mental workers, high labor intensity was associated with greater BA acceleration: KDMAge β  =  0.40, 95% CI [0.10-0.65]; PhenoAge β  =  0.51, 95% CI [0.10-1.38]. In manual workers, high labor intensity also correlated with increased BA acceleration: KDMAge β  =  1.53, 95% CI [0.91-2.12]; PhenoAge β  =  1.32, 95% CI [0.37-2.26]. Mediation analysis showed that VAI mediated 9.8% of the mental work-PhenoAge relationship and 20.9% of the KDMAge relationship. Mental work is associated with accelerated biological aging. These results highlight the importance of interventions targeting work intensity and metabolic health to reduce age-related disease burdens.

In this narrative review, the authors aimed to provide a focused overview, grounded in scientific literature, of the most common primary and secondary headaches frequently observed in patients with orofacial pain as well as orofacial conditions that may mimic primary headache disorders. In addition, they highlighted the clinically significant overlap between headaches and temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). Information was sourced from the International Classification of Headache Disorders, Third Edition, for headache diagnoses and from the International Classification of Orofacial Pain for orofacial pain diagnoses. Management guidelines were from the European Academy of Neurology. Data on the overlap between headache disorders and TMDs were drawn from a systematic review and observational studies. The authors provided a concise, practical, clinical guide for identifying and managing primary and secondary headaches commonly encountered in dental practice, which is grounded in established guidelines and robust scientific evidence. The authors emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary management and a thorough diagnostic approach to enhance treatment outcomes for patients with concurrent headaches and TMD, highlighting the frequent overlap of these disorders. For dental care clinicians and other health care practitioners, recognizing the intersection of orofacial pain, headaches, and TMD is crucial. This understanding promotes better diagnosis, encourages interdisciplinary collaboration, and is the best approach to improved patient care and treatment outcomes.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) affects >25% of women worldwide and often recurs after standard-of-care metronidazole (MTZ) treatment. LACTIN-V, a live biotherapeutic product (LBP) containing Lactobacillus crispatus strain CTV-05, reduced recurrent BV in a Phase 2b clinical trial, but efficacy was incomplete. We characterized microbiota and immune effects and correlates of treatment success in trial samples. By week 12, L. crispatus-dominant microbiota was achieved in 30% of LBP recipients compared to 9% of placebo (benefit ratio: 3.31; p<0.005). This effect was mostly due to CTV-05, but native L. crispatus strains were also present and increased over time. Inflammatory cytokines decreased in both arms after MTZ, but returned to baseline in placebo recipients. L. crispatus colonization was associated with pre-MTZ microbiota, baseline cytokine profiles, post-MTZ bacterial load, and clinical and behavioral variables. These findings elucidate LBP microbiota effects and identify predictors of treatment success, informing improved intervention strategies to advance womens health.

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined how the quality of life (QOL) of primary caregivers of children with asthma varies according to asthma severity and control. We also compared caregiver QOL with that of caregivers of healthy children and explored variation across specific QOL domains. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to October 2023. Eligible studies reported caregiver QOL in relation to asthma severity, asthma control, or healthy controls. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. QOL scores were standardised to a 0-100 scale (0 = lowest, 100 = highest) and synthesised using random-effects meta-analysis. Thirteen studies were included. Caregivers of healthy children had the highest QOL (79.63; 95% CI: 69.51-89.75), while those of children with severe persistent asthma reported lower scores (59.63; 95% CI: 55.26-64.00). QOL was also higher among caregivers of children with good asthma control (76.71; 95% CI: 67.58-85.84) compared to those with poor control (62.48; 95% CI: 50.15-74.81). Emotional well-being and activity limitations were the domains most consistently associated with severity and control levels. Caregiver QOL is associated with asthma severity and control. Our findings underscore the need for consistent symptom monitoring and management, and suggest that caregiver support should be a routine consideration in paediatric asthma care.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia typically presents with postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss due to atherosclerotic stenosis of mesenteric arteries. Endovascular treatment has become the first-line management, demonstrating lower early mortality and fewer complications compared to open surgery. Recent evidence shows that covered stents provide superior long-term outcomes, with better primary patency and freedom from reintervention than bare-metal stents. While patient selection remains crucial, with endovascular treatment being preferred for older, higher-risk patients and shorter lesions, it offers shorter hospital stays and comparable survival rates to open surgery for most patients. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current endovascular management strategies for chronic mesenteric ischemia, including patient selection, technical considerations, and outcomes.

In this study, we aimed to determine the factors affecting satisfaction and expectations of prenatal care among refugee pregnant women. We conducted this study as cross-sectional. We collected using an survey from 208 refugee pregnant women using the Personal Information Form and Prenatal Care Satisfaction and Patient Expectations (PESPC) scale. Most of the refugee pregnant women (79.8%) had attended only three or fewer antenatal care appointments. We found that although refugee pregnant women were moderately satisfied with the prenatal care they received, their expectations were low. Our findings suggest the need to enhance prenatal care services for pregnant women with refugee status and to implement well planned, strategic interventions. Adapting prenatal care to migrants and refugees and focusing on their needs can also improve the use of health services and reduce inequalities.

"South Korea-despite its ""drug-free"" reputation-exhibits an increasing incidence of drug use, particularly among youths. In this age group, both environmental and individual factors influence illegal drug use. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of illicit drug use and examine the association between individual and environmental factors and drug use among Korean youths. We administered a cross-sectional survey among South Koreans aged 18-24 years through an online panel; the survey assessed participants' characteristics and drug use, as well as relevant individual and environmental factors. The synthetic minority oversampling technique addressed variable imbalance. Logistic regression models analyzed associations between factors and drug use, while Shapley values determined these factors' relative importance. The lifetime prevalence of drug use among the participating youths was 3.9%, with prescription drugs and inhalants being the most prevalent. Negative attitudes toward drugs, a high awareness of South Korea's drug problem, and knowledge of drug use's consequences were associated with lower drug use. High peer pressure, perceived peer drug use, and drug availability were associated with elevated drug use, as were younger age, sexual minority status, living abroad, poor health, and high stress. The high prevalence of prescription drug and inhalant use among South Korean youths suggests that the perception that the country is drug-free is inaccurate and emphasizes the need for targeted intervention strategies. Effective prevention measures should include community education regarding drug risks, early detection of at-risk individuals, and enhanced access to tailored treatment alternatives."

This paper researches the expression of the C-FOS gene. and Thr241Met talking in the XRCC3 gene in patients with gastric cancer and healthy individuals. Controls, in an attempt to clarify their behavior as possible disease susceptibility molecular markers. A total of 100 gastric cancer patients and 100 matched healthy individuals were enrolled, with genomic DNA and RNA extracted from blood samples. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess C-FOS expression, while PCR-RFLP determined XRCC3 Thr241Met genotypes. The C-FOS and the Thr/Met XRCC3 genotypes, 12 genotypes revealed that C-FOS was significantly overexpressed in patients than in controls (P <0.001). The XRCC3 Thr/Met genotype was very frequent in patients, as well (P =0.0020). Also, blood type A, family history of gastric cancer, and residing in the country were shown to be categorized as major factors of the risk, and were not significant factors. These results indicate that upregulation of C-FOS and the XRCC3 Thr241Met variant are risk factors of gastric cancer and that blood type and familial history are additional risk factors. We present in our findings that molecular profiling coupled with demographic profiling is highly relevant in risk assessment and early detection techniques in gastric cancer. The study contributes to the further comprehension of the molecular pathogenesis of gastric carcinogenesis and suggests C-FOS and XRCC3 as possible clinical and epidemiological markers.

Administration of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies can suppress viremia and prevent infection in vivo . However, clinical use is challenged by broad envelope sequence diversity and rapid emergence of viral escape 1-9 . Here, we performed single B cell profiling of 32 top HIV-1 elite neutralizers to identify broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) with highest potency and breadth for clinical application. From 831 expressed monoclonal antibodies, we identified 04_A06, a new V H 1-2-encoded CD4 binding site bNAb with remarkable breadth and potency against extended multiclade pseudovirus panels (GeoMean IC 50 = 0.059 µg/ml, breadth = 98.5%, 332 virus strains). Moreover, 04_A06 was not susceptible to classic viral CD4bs escape variants and maintained full viral suppression in HIV-1-infected humanized mice. Structural analyses revealed that antiviral activity is mediated by an unusually long 11-amino acid heavy chain insertion. This insertion facilitates inter-protomer contacts and interactions with highly conserved residues on the adjacent gp120 protomer. Finally, 04_A06 demonstrated high activity against contemporaneously circulating viruses from the Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) trials (GeoMean IC 50 = 0.082 µg/ml, breadth = 98.4%, 191 virus strains) and in silico modeling for 04_A06LS predicted HIV-1 prevention efficacy of >93%. Thus, 04_A06 will provide unique opportunities for effective treatment and prevention strategies of HIV-1 infection.

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) affects millions of individuals worldwide and has no known curative treatment, making it a serious global health concern. The management of its development depends on early discovery, and X-ray imaging is a fundamental diagnostic technique. However, due to variations in radiologists' levels of experience, manual X-ray interpretation increases variability and possible inaccuracies. Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning techniques have sparked the creation of automated systems for the radiological identification of osteoarthritis in the knee. However, for early-stage detection, obtaining greater prediction accuracy is still crucial. By utilizing the insights gathered from a bigger dataset, models trained on smaller, domain-specific datasets perform better through the use of transfer learning. Due to its depth and effectiveness, XceptionNet is especially well-suited for jobs involving the interpretation of medical images. In contrast to previous research, this method efficiently addresses dataset imbalance by using class balancing approaches, integrating a customized preprocessing pipeline, and adding customized architectural improvements to XceptionNet, which improves early-stage KOA identification. With the use of these state-of-the-art methods, The suggested approach shows potential in correctly identifying osteoarthritis from radiographic images of the knee, attaining 97% prediction accuracy, 97.8% precision, 97.6% recall, and 97.6% F1-measure. Additionally, the generated model showed 95.94% Cohen's kappa value, which indicates good agreement. The study supports further efforts to develop trustworthy, automated disease detection technology, which improves patient outcomes and facilitates more efficient healthcare delivery.

This hospital-based case-control study aims to evaluate hematological and biochemical markers for the diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis (CE) in the Tibetan population of Sichuan. This study involved 83 patients diagnosed with CE and 45 healthy controls. Diagnosis of CE was confirmed through antibody and imaging tests, followed by an analysis of differences in blood and biochemical markers. (1) Patients with CE displayed significant abnormalities in blood and biochemical indicators compared to healthy subjects, including increased levels of platelet count, eosinophil percentage, basophil percentage, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, γ-glutamyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Conversely, there was a decrease in lymphocyte percentage, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, and hematocrit. (2) Prothrombin time levels were markedly elevated beyond normal reference values, with prolonged prothrombin time identified as a significant predictor for CE. (3) The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting CE based on prothrombin time was 0.969, while the AUC for predicting CE using a combination of prothrombin time and eosinophil percentage was 0.982. Prolonged prothrombin time serves as a crucial indicator for CE, and its combination with eosinophil percentage significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, offering a potentially useful screening strategy in resource-limited endemic regions.

This ensures the absolute prevention of carry-over contamination and makes the system very safe and simple to use in point-of-need settings. As few as 60 Campylobacter genome copies per reaction could be successfully detected with CampyTube. We have primarily developed and evaluated CampyTube for the detection of Campylobacter in chicken neck skin samples and could reach 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the samples exceeding the regulatory limit of 1000 CFU/g confirmed microbiologically, while the sensitivity in all samples that tested positive using qPCR (1.4 × 102-2.5 × 106 genome copies/g) was 71.1%. We discuss the impact of sample preparation on CampyTube performance and suggest further options for test optimization. CampyTube is a highly versatile and efficient, yet simple, affordable, and material-saving system that can be adapted for other targets and sample types.

The utility of bio-reductive prodrugs in cancer research has emerged as an attractive strategy. We synthesized and characterized a couple of cobalt(iii)-Schiff base complexes of general molecular formula Co(L1)(L2) [Co(iii)-dione] and Co(L1)(dox) [Co(iii)-dox], where L1 and L2 are N,N-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(1-(pyridine-2-yl)methanimine) and 1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione, and dox = doxorubicin, as bio-reductive prodrugs. UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopic assays confirmed the reductive release of doxorubicin from the complex [Co(iii)-dox] in a GSH-dependent manner under physiological conditions, showing its potential for in vitro drug release. The rate of doxorubicin release was found to be 8.20 min-1 at pH 5.5 in the presence of 10 mM GSH. The complex [Co(iii)-dox] primarily targets mitochondria and displayed remarkable anticancer effects against A549, hypoxic A549, HT29, and MDA-MB-231 cells with IC50 values in the range of 9.88-17.89 μM (24 h incubation), suggesting its ability to overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) and reduce side effects associated with traditional doxorubicin therapy. The IC50 value determined against HaCaT cells was >30 μM. The colony formation, wound healing, and invasion assays revealed the capacity of the complex [Co(iii)-dox] to inhibit tumor growth, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis showed notable downregulation of key hypoxia-adaptive genes (HIF-1α, VEGF, and GLUT-1), disrupting tumor survival mechanisms. Overall, the complex [Co(iii)-dox] emerged as an excellent bio-reductive prodrug for safer and potent anticancer activity.

Asthma poses a global health challenge, requiring an understanding of its burden to guide policy. Using GBD 2021 data, this study aims to assess the burden of asthma worldwide. We extracted data on asthma prevalence, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from GBD for the period 1990-2021. Age-standardized rates (ASR) and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPC) were calculated to understand trends. We analyzed variations in asthma burden across gender and age groups, and explored the correlation between socio-demographic index (SDI) and asthma burden. Furthermore, we examined the main risk factors contributing to asthma. Lastly, we predicted the future asthma burden over the next 8 years. High population countries such as India and China reported higher numbers of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs. From 1990 to 2021, the ASR of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for asthma showed an overall downward trend. Children under 14 years of age demonstrated notably higher incidence rates, with the highest concentrations observed among those below 5 years, whereas the elderly population (>90 years) exhibited the peak prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) burden. Gender differences were observed, with males having a higher burden before age 15-19, and females afterward. In China, smoking emerged as a significant risk factor for men, while the risk associated with high body mass index (BMI) has increased notably in recent years. Both incidence and prevalence in China are projected to decrease in the future. This study finds 15-19 years is a key turning point for gender differences in asthma burden, pinpointing smoking, high BMI, and NO₂ as risk factors. From 2022-2030, asthma prevalence/incidence is set to decline overall but rise in 15-19-year-olds, highlighting adolescence as a new prevention focus and a call for better health education in China.

A subset of adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients undergoing corrective surgery receive a disproportionate level of medical resources and incur greater costs. We examined the characteristics of such super-utilizers of health care resources among ASD patients. This prospective, multicenter study analyzed data from ASD patients with > 4 levels of spinal fusion and a minimum 2-year follow-up. Index and total episode-of-care (EOC) costs in 2022 US dollars were calculated using average itemized direct costs obtained from administrative hospital records. Patients with total 2-year EOC cost > 90th percentile were considered super-utilizers, the characteristics of which we identified through a multivariate generalized logistic model. Of 1299 eligible patients, mean age was 60 years, 73% were female and 92% were Caucasian. Super-utilizers were older (+2.1 years; p = 0.012), had greater depression (34.2 vs 25.7%; p = 0.03), increased frailty (p = 0.009) comorbidities (p = 0.005), higher reoperation rates (54.4 vs 15.0%; p < 0.001), hospital length of stay (+ 3 days; p < 0.0001), higher surgical invasiveness (+28.6; p < 0.001), more vertebrae fused (+ 3; p < 0.0001); interbody fusions (80 vs 55%; p < 0.0001), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) use (87.3 vs 69.4%; p = 0.0001), operative time (+91 min; p < 0.0001), and blood loss (+620 mL; p < 0.0001) compared to other ASD patients. Index cost was 65% (p < 0.0001), and cost/quality-adjusted life-year was three times higher among super-utilizers. ASD patients with depression who undergo more complex or revision spinal surgical procedures are more likely to be super-utilizers. Identifying likely super-utilizers within the ASD population may enable targeted interventions and preoperative planning to reduce unnecessary costs, while improving patient outcomes.

Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of work absence globally. Digital interventions have the potential to increase access to self-management support for individuals with persistent LBP. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of a digital educational program (MyRelief) designed to support self-management strategies for people with persistent LBP. A prospective uncontrolled feasibility study was conducted across 4 countries (Italy, Portugal, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) between 2020 and 2021. Adults in employment with nonspecific persistent LBP (>3 mo) with access to the internet were eligible to participate. Participants were given access to MyRelief, an 8-unit evidence-based educational self-management program. The feasibility of the MyRelief program was assessed using recruitment rates, an a priori success threshold of >70% of the target sample (50 participants), and a retention <35% dropout rate. Pre- and postintervention measures of functional disability were assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and health-related quality of life using the 5-level EuroQol questionnaire. Additional postintervention measures included the Patient Enablement Instrument and the System Usability Scale. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, and qualitative feedback was analyzed using a reflexive analytical approach. The recruitment feasibility threshold was met, and 40/50 (80%) participants (19 male and 21 female; mean age 57 years) were enrolled in the study. A total of 17 participants (11 male and 6 female) completed both the baseline and 12-week follow-up questionnaires. This represented a retention rate of 42.5% (17/40) and a dropout rate of 57.5%, which did not meet the a priori criteria of <35% dropouts. Approximately half of the participants presented with low baseline disability scores (mean ODI 24.0; 95% CI 18-31) with no significant change at follow-up (mean ODI 23.9; 95% CI 16-31). The 5-level EuroQol questionnaire scores improved from 0.68 (95% CI 0.608-0.76) to 0.72 (95% CI 0.66-0.79), indicating a clinically significant change. Patient Enablement Instrument scores postintervention were high (mean 5.31), indicating good perceived enablement. The mean System Usability Scale score was 72.4 (95% CI 67.5-73.3), indicating a good level of perceived ease-of-use. Overall, the quality of outcome measure completion was high (100%). Qualitative feedback indicated areas for improvement relating to challenges around access and navigation within the website. The MyRelief study demonstrated feasibility in terms of recruitment but not retention. However, low baseline disability levels are not representative of the wider persistent LBP population. Future studies should broaden recruitment strategies, in particular, by recruiting from health care settings to improve representativeness. Although usability met industry standards, qualitative feedback suggests that navigation and accessibility require further optimization to better align with end user preferences for digital health interventions.

Pelvic bone sarcomas are rare, heterogeneous malignancies that present significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Despite advances in imaging, surgical navigation, and multidisciplinary care, it remains unclear whether these innovations have improved outcomes across all histiotypes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 475 patients surgically treated for primary pelvic bone sarcomas between 2003 and 2022. Patients were stratified into historical (2003-2012) and modern (2013-2022) cohorts. We assessed disease-specific survival (DSS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), surgical margin status, reconstruction trends, and adoption of navigation technologies. Chondrosarcoma (51 %) was the most common tumour, followed by Ewing sarcoma (16 %) and osteosarcoma (11 %). Use of navigation and patient-specific planning significantly increased in the modern cohort, correlating with reduced positive margin rates (8.5 % vs. 21 %; p < 0.001). DSS improved for chondrosarcoma (p = 0.027) and chordoma (p = 0.040), while LRFS improved for chondrosarcoma (p = 0.003), Ewing sarcoma (p = 0.007), and chordoma (p = 0.045). No significant DSS improvement was seen in osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma. Advances in centralization, and technical advances have significantly improved local control and survival, particularly for chondrosarcoma and sacral chordoma. However, outcomes for osteosarcoma and ES remain constrained, highlighting the need for ongoing innovation and multidisciplinary strategies.

Previous studies have demonstrated that preoperative oral carbohydrates (CHO) can alleviate postoperative insulin resistance (IR) and enhance recovery in non-diabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, the potential benefits in diabetic patients remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of preoperative CHO on IR and postoperative recovery in diabetic patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). A prospective, single-center, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted in the Adult Cardiac Surgery Ward 6 of a large-volume cardiovascular center. A total of 62 consecutive diabetic patients scheduled for isolated OPCAB were prospectively enrolled between July 8, 2022, and April 28, 2023. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the CHO group or the control (CTRL) group using computer-generated random numbers. Patients in the CHO group received 335 mL of a carbohydrate drink containing 50 g of carbohydrates 8 to 12 hours before surgery, while those in the CTRL group followed routine fasting protocols. The primary endpoint was postoperative IR, assessed by the homeostasis model assessment. Secondary endpoints included postoperative inflammatory markers and stress responses (e.g., serum cortisol levels), while exploratory endpoints focused on in-hospital clinical outcomes. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. CHO administration significantly reduced postoperative inflammatory markers but did not significantly improve IR. Stress response was attenuated in the CHO group, though the difference was not statistically significant. Postoperative drainage was higher in the CHO group, but no differences were observed in other clinical outcomes. Preoperative CHO may attenuate inflammatory and stress responses without increasing perioperative risk in diabetic patients undergoing OPCAB, although its effect IR remains uncertain.

Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease, is clinically characterized by resting tremor, rigidity and postural balance disorder. Its pathological essence is the progressive degenerative death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), leading to a significant decrease in striatal dopamine (DA) levels. This results in the dysfunction of basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex (BGTC) circuit. This circuit is the core neural circuit of motor control, and its abnormality not only directly causes the motor symptoms of PD, but also participates in the cascade of disease progression through the disorder of neurotransmitter signals. At present, DA replacement therapy and DA receptors (DARs) agonists are still the main methods of clinical treatment, but single therapy cannot fully correct the imbalance of other neurotransmitter systems, which has significant limitations in long-term efficacy and symptom management. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), as the largest family of membrane proteins, have become important targets for PD treatment due to their extensive participation in physiological regulatory networks and excellent drug development potential. These transmembrane signaling molecules play important roles in multiple key nodes in the pathological process of PD by precisely regulating the release of neurotransmitters, the maintenance of synaptic plasticity and the dynamic balance of neural circuits. Here, we review the transition of BCTG in the context of PD and then focus on the pathological cascade of GPCRs mediating PD in this loop. Finally, we update the clinical trials or approvals of GPCR drugs under investigation for the treatment of PD.

Timely access to breast cancer care is critical for improving prognosis and survival, but multiple barriers can lead to prolonged intervals across the care pathway. This scoping review aims to identify the methods used to measure timeliness in breast cancer care, pinpoint specific points in the care pathway where longer time intervals are most common and categorise the factors influencing the timeliness of care in Africa. Scoping review followed the methodological framework for scoping reviews outlined by Arksey and O'Malley. Five electronic databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of science, and PsycINFO, were searched for articles published between 1999 and 2024, and the Google search engine was used to search for grey literature. We included studies that measured time to presentation, diagnosis or treatment within the context of breast cancer care in Africa, and/or assessed one or more of these care intervals. Two reviewers independently screened relevant abstracts and full texts against the selection criteria. Key themes were then synthesised narratively based on a predefined theoretical framework adapted from the Model of Pathways to Treatment and Andersen's model of health service. The initial search identified 3552 articles, with 29 studies ultimately included for data charting. All the included studies drew samples from healthcare facilities. This review identified seven multidirectional key time points: symptom onset, recognising the need for help, engaging with informal care providers, presenting at a health facility, receiving a diagnosis, consulting a specialist and starting treatment. The review also revealed significant variation in the terminology used for time events and in the metrics defining time intervals. The time interval between symptom recognition and contact with a healthcare provider was the most frequently studied and was often longer than other intervals. In many African countries, traditional healers and spiritual sites were the first point of contact for many patients with breast cancer after noticing initial symptoms. There was a scarcity of research into completion of cancer treatment and follow-up, despite significant barriers in accessing and affording cancer care. This review highlights significant variation in how timeliness of breast cancer care are defined and measured across African countries, underscoring the need for standardised tools to assess care intervals. The predominance of facility-based studies may overlook patients who never reach formal healthcare settings, pointing to a critical gap in community-level evidence. These findings emphasise the importance of adopting a systems-based approach to improve breast cancer care, one that integrates both formal and informal care pathways and actively involves patients in navigating timely access to services.

To assess the incidence of delirium and its predictors among adult patients admitted to the intensive care units of comprehensive specialised hospitals in the Amhara region of northwest Ethiopia from 18 October 2024 to 20 February 2025. A multicentre prospective observational study was conducted. Four comprehensive specialised hospitals in the Amhara region of northwest Ethiopia, from 18 October 2024 to 20 February 2025. A total of 351 patients were included in the final analysis during the study period. The primary outcome measure of this study was the incidence of delirium. Additionally, the study investigated the factors associated with delirium incidence among adult patients admitted to intensive care units. The incidence of delirium among adult patients in intensive care units was 42.17% (95% CI: 37.08 to 47.42). Pain (adjusted HR (AHR) = 4.74; 95% CI: 2.38 to 9.44), mechanical ventilation (AHR = 2.96; 95% CI: 1.56 to 5.63), age 65 years or older (AHR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.48 to 3.21) and agitation (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) ≥1) (AHR = 3.26; 95% CI: 2.09 to 5.09) were statistically significant factors associated with delirium. In the present study, more than one-third of patients developed delirium. Pain, mechanical ventilation, age 65 or older and agitation (RASS≥1) were significantly associated with delirium occurrence. To reduce the incidence of delirium, the current study recommends treating or preventing pain and agitation. Additionally, special attention should be given to patients receiving mechanical ventilation and those aged 65 or older during care.

The intestinal microbiota composition has been linked to neurocognitive impairment in people with HIV (PWH). However, the potential interplay of microbial species and related metabolites, particularly in the context of an HIV cure strategy remains underexplored. The BCN02 trial evaluated the impact of romidepsin (RMD), used as a HIV-1 latency reversing agent and with reported beneficial neurological effects, combined with the MVA.HIVconsv vaccine on virus control during 32-weeks of monitored antiretroviral treatment interruption (MAP) in early-treated HIV-infected individuals. Here, we analyzed longitudinal gut microbiome, plasma metabolome and brain functioning data to identify potential associations and novel putative biomarkers of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Data from fecal shotgun metagenomics, plasma metabolome, cognitive (standardized neuropsychological test score covering 6 cognitive domains, NPZ-6), functional (neuropsychiatric symptoms) and neuroimaging assessments were obtained and evaluated in 18 participants before and after RMD administration, and at the study end (post-MAP follow-up) in the BCN02 trial. Participants with neurocognitive impairment (Lower vs. Higher NPZ-6 score group) were enriched in bacterial species, including Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Sutterella wadsworthensis and Streptococcus thermophilus, and showed higher 1,2-propanediol degradation microbial pathway levels, before RMD administration. A multi-omics profiling showed significant and positive correlations between these microbial features and lipid-related metabolic pathways, previously linked to neurological disorders (i.e., sphingolipid, ether lipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism), in participants with neurocognitive impairment, before RMD administration. Three indices (microbial-, metabolite-based and combined) obtained from the discriminant features were assessed longitudinally, showing progressive similarities between NPZ-6 score groups over time. Furthermore, the three indices and related discriminant features correlated negatively with functional outcomes, such as quality of life and daily functioning, and positively with depression, stress and CNS-related symptoms before RMD administration, while these associations became less discernible at the subsequent timepoints. While the direct effect of the intervention on the observed shifts cannot be conclusively determined in this study settings, these findings strengthen the link between gut bacteria, related metabolites, and neurocognitive function in PWH, and provide an analytical framework for future validation studies aimed at discovering predictive biomarkers for neurocognitive impairment in PWH.

Mindfulness-based couple interventions have been generally recognized as effective in enhancing relationship outcomes. However, it remains unclear specifically for whom and under what conditions such programs benefit couple relationships, leaving important clinical implications overlooked. To answer these questions, the current systematic research synthesis aimed to explore preliminary trends by (a) identifying potential patterns in how relationship benefits may differ based on sample characteristics, (b) comparing conditions of program delivery, and (c) reviewing methodological issues to provide insight for future research and interventions. A search of peer-reviewed quantitative studies published from January 2000 to April 2025 resulted in 444 studies. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 21 studies involving 2,508 couples plus 328 individuals were included. Overall, most mindfulness-based couple intervention programs included predominantly White, well-educated, different-sex couples and were conducted in multi-couple, in-person group settings. Although some patterns emerged, the limited number and heterogeneity of studies warrant cautious interpretation. Preliminary trends suggested that people of color and low-SES couples could benefit comparably, or in some cases, possibly even more from participating in mindfulness-based couple interventions, especially when programs are tailored to their contexts. Compared to patients with chronic health conditions, their enrolled partners tended to benefit less. Male partners of pregnant women seemed to benefit more. Regarding intervention conditions, the findings on the benefit of homework practices were mixed. Methodological themes (e.g., use of control groups, self-report measures, interdependence among couple members) were also summarized and followed with suggestions for future work (e.g., dismantling studies, observational, physiological, and multi-informant methods).

Background/Objectives: Occupational well-being and professional quality of life are essential for healthcare sustainability. While clinical staff are presumed to experience higher stress, few studies have compared their experience to that of non-clinical personnel within the same institution. Methods: This observational study involved 63 employees from an Italian research hospital: 36 healthcare workers in critical care and 27 administrative staff. Participants completed the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory (Brief COPE), an ad hoc organizational questionnaire, and the ProQoL Version 5 (administered to clinical staff only). Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square) were used to explore group differences. Results: No significant differences emerged between groups in coping styles or strategies. Significant differences were observed only in reports of work-related injuries (42% of healthcare staff vs. 4% of administrative staff; p = 0.002) and perceived disruption caused by vacation requests (64% vs. 26%; p = 0.006). Other organizational indicators such as job dissatisfaction, intention to leave, or perceived managerial support did not differ significantly. ProQoL results showed that 53% of healthcare workers had moderate to high burnout, and 47.2% scored high on compassion fatigue, while only 2.7% showed high levels of secondary traumatic stress. Conclusions: Despite distinct operational contexts, healthcare and administrative staff reported broadly similar experiences in terms of coping and organizational well-being. These findings challenge assumptions of stark differences across professional roles and suggest that workplace well-being strategies should address the needs of both clinical and non-clinical staff.

"Critical care medicine (CCM) is a clinical discipline that focuses on the pathological mechanisms and comprehensive treatment of critically ill patients. The intensive care unit (ICU), as the clinical base of CCM, is responsible for implementing comprehensive management of critically ill patients throughout their entire care cycle, encompassing a series of integrated measures ranging from early warning to rehabilitation. Driven by national policy, the discipline achieved rapid advancement. In 2024, the National Health Commission and seven other ministries jointly issued the ""Framework on Strengthening Critical Care Medical Service Capabilities"", marking the discipline's entry into a high-quality development phase. Accordingly, the Chinese Society of Critical Care Medicine (CSCCM) formulated the""Guidelines for the capacity building and advancement of critical care medicine in China (2025 edition)"". The guidelines focus on key aspects of discipline construction and development, covering nine areas: ICU infrastructure planning, professional staffing and technical competencies, equipment standardization, quality management, continuing education, scientific research, emergency preparedness, and service model innovation. The Recommendation development process involved initiation, literature retrieval and screening, and the synthesis of medical evidence to establish preliminary recommendations. These recommendations underwent multiple rounds of expert review, including correspondence review, remote and in-person meetings, revisions, and voting by the CSCCM Standing Committee, ultimately leading to the final version. The recommendations apply to ICUs in secondary and tertiary healthcare institutions and serve as a scientific framework for discipline planning, construction, and management, aiming to enhance the quality of critical care services."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between the blepharospasm disability index (BSDI) and botulinum neurotoxin (BTX) dosage for patients affected by either benign essential blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm. Cross-sectional cohort study evaluating adult patients diagnosed with benign essential blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm who completed a BSDI evaluation prior to receiving same-day therapeutic BTX injections. Primary outcome measures included BSDI score and number of BTX units. Simple and multivariable linear regression analyses were utilized to assess the relationship between BSDI score and BTX dosage. For patients with benign essential blepharospasm, BTX dosage was significantly and positively correlated to BSDI score (R2=0.16, β=1.15, p=0.007). This relationship remained robust when controlling for age, sex, disease duration, interval since previous BTX injection, and injecting provider (β=1.11, p=0.010). No significant correlation was identified between BSDI score and BTX dosage for patients affected by hemifacial spasm (R2=0.05, β=0.39, p=0.379). This study demonstrates that BTX dosage is significantly and positively correlated to BSDI score for patients affected by benign essential blepharospasm, but not for those affected by hemifacial spasm. Incorporating BSDI score may support more individualized and efficient clinical management of benign essential blepharospasm.

Due to ozonated water's antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, it may be used as a supplementary treatment to scaling and root planing (SRP). The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of using ozonated water instead of tap water during the SRP for people with chronic generalized periodontitis. This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 30 patients with generalized periodontitis Stages I and II, randomly allocated to two groups. Test sites were subjected to ozonated water, and control sites were subjected to tap water. The clinical periodontal parameters were measured at baseline, the 4th, and 8th week of treatment. Findings showed a significant decrease in periodontal pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and gingival index (GI) at both the 4th and the 8th week of treatment in both groups. PPD was further reduced in the test group, but the difference between the two groups was not significant. However, the greater reduction of CAL at the 4th and 8th week (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) and also the greater reduction of GI at the 4th week (p = 0.01) was observed in the test group. Both the test and control groups showed clinical improvement following nonsurgical periodontal therapy. The ozonated water group demonstrated significantly greater reductions in CAL at the 4th and 8th weeks, and in GI at the 4th week. However, the magnitude of these differences was modest and may have limited clinical relevance. Further research is needed to confirm long-term outcomes.

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CGuard dual-layer stent with its mesh embolic protection system (EPS) in elective cases for treatment of internal carotid artery stenosis and compares it to the Carotid Wallstent as benchmark. In this retrospective, multicenter study, we analyzed data from consecutive patients who underwent carotid artery stenting with CGuard at two high-volume neurointerventional centers and compared them with prior consecutive patients treated with Carotid Wallstent (CWS), with and without a balloon guiding catheter (BGC) as protection, at the same institutions. Patient demographics, procedural details, clinical complications, early in-stent thrombosis and occlusion rates, and late follow-up restenosis rates were assessed. A total of 428 patients were treated, 144 with the CGuard stent, 203 with CWS + BGC and 83 with CWS-BGC, the majority of patients for symptomatic stenoses. Technical success was achieved in 98.6% of CGuard patients. No clinical complications were observed in CGuard patients, however the clinical complication rate was 2.96% (6/203) for CWS + BGC and 4.94% (4/83) for CWS-BGC patients (p = 0.052). The in-hospital stent occlusion rate was 0.69% (1/144) for CGuard and 2.1% (6/286) in CWS ± BGC patients (p = 0.49). On long-term follow-up (mean 9.9 months) the CGuard demonstrated a comparatively low rate of restenosis (6.25%) and retreatment (2.1%). The CGuard dual-layer stent was safe and effective for carotid artery stenting in our series. Its design appears to contribute to a low risk of periprocedural complications, high technical success rate, while maintaining restenosis rates comparable to the Carotid Wallstent.

Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is characterized by systemic inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction and is often associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis. Rifaximin, a gut-specific non-absorbable antibiotic, is known to modulate the gut microbiota. Here, we investigated rifaximin's effects and mechanisms in SAP using murine models and a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2100049794). In mice, rifaximin attenuated pancreatic injury and systemic inflammation and altered gut microbiota composition by decreasing mucin-degrading genera such as Akkermansia (P < 0.05). These protective effects persisted in antibiotic-treated and germ-free mice, suggesting mechanisms not solely dependent on gut microbiota modulation. In patients with predicted SAP (n  =  60), rifaximin significantly reduced systemic inflammation compared with controls. WBC decreased from a median of 11.50 × 10⁹/L (IQR 8.76-15.68) to 8.49 × 10⁹/L (6.93-10.20; P = 0.04) and TNF-α from 15.05 pg/mL (12.73-19.75) to 11.00 pg/mL (8.74-15.40; P = 0.009). However, the incidence of culture-confirmed infection did not differ between the rifaximin and control groups (13.3% vs. 13.3%; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.28-3.63). Adverse events were comparable between groups. Metagenomic analyses revealed suppression of mucin-degrading bacteria (e.g., Akkermansia, Bacteroides fragilis, and Hungatella hathewayi) (P < 0.05) and reductions in mucin-degrading carbohydrate-active enzymes, including sialidases and fucosidases. In conclusion, among patients with predicted SAP, rifaximin did not reduce culture-confirmed infectious complications within 90 days after randomization compared with standard care, despite significant improvements in systemic inflammatory markers and selected fecal microbiome features. Larger randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate these findings. Although rifaximin has been used to target gut-derived inflammation in other contexts, its role in SAP remains largely unexplored. In this study, rifaximin treatment was associated with reduced pancreatic injury and systemic inflammation in both murine models and patients with predicted SAP. Treatment also led to changes in gut microbial composition, notably a decrease in mucin-degrading taxa. Importantly, similar protective effects were also observed in antibiotic-treated and germ-free mice, indicating that rifaximin may act via microbiota-dependent and host-directed pathways. These findings offer novel insights into the gut-pancreas axis and suggest that rifaximin holds therapeutic potential by modulating gut microbial composition and host inflammatory responses in SAP.

Increasing wildfire activity in mesic, temperate Pacific Northwest forests west of the Cascade Range crest has stimulated interest in understanding whether alternative forest management practices could reduce risk of stand-replacing fire. To explore how management can enhance fire resistance in these forests and assess tradeoffs among resistance enhancement, carbon sequestration and storage, and economic returns, we conducted 40-year simulations of stand development with BioSum, a framework for conducting landscape analysis with the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS), utilizing a statistically representative and spatially balanced sample of Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots. Simulation outcomes under business-as-usual silviculture were contrasted with fire-aware silviculture, and treatment optimization logic was developed and applied to represent landscape-scale outcomes under business-as-usual and fire-focused management scenarios. Simulation results indicate that fire-aware prescriptions and fire-focused management can meaningfully enhance stand- and landscape-scale fire resistance of westside forests under less than extreme fire weather, but at the cost of lower economic returns and reduced net carbon storage and sequestration over the 40-year analysis window. Shifting from business-as-usual regeneration harvests with short rotations to fire-aware, episodic selection harvest improved fire resistance the most, especially in young privately-owned forests, and with only modest tradeoffs in carbon and economic outcomes. While fire-aware treatments generally reduced net present value from forest operations over business-as-usual, most treatments still generated positive net present value and could be implemented without subsidy. Fire-aware prescriptions that removed and utilized non-merchantable harvest residues instead of burning them, via either pile or broadcast burning, partially mitigated carbon emissions associated with fire-aware treatments, with about the same improvement in fire resistance. Given the currently limited institutional and financial capacity to implement fire resistance enhancing treatments at scale, the insights from this analysis may aid managers seeking to elevate fire resistance to prioritize where and how to manage.

Hematologic abnormalities in children with Down Syndrome (DS) have previously been described, but with inconsistent conclusions. A retrospective single-institution cohort study was conducted to evaluate complete blood count (CBC) ranges in children with DS. Mean values for CBC results are presented by age and sex, as a clinical resource for the evaluation of DS children. In comparison to reference values, children with DS had higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV), lower absolute lymphocyte count, and a trend toward higher hemoglobin (Hgb) values. The presence of these findings across the cohort suggests that these are benign hematologic variations in DS.

Background The prevalence of white coat hypertension (WCH) among surgical patients is a significant concern. WCH refers to a condition where individuals with normal blood pressure at home exhibit elevated readings when measured at a medical facility, affecting clinical decision-making processes. The aim is to determine the prevalence of WCH among patients undergoing elective surgery at a tertiary care hospital and to evaluate its association with demographic factors, surgical type, and perioperative waiting time. A cross-sectional design was employed, enrolling 150 patients. The findings reveal a significant prevalence of WCH, especially among female patients, with varying prevalence rates across different surgical procedures. These results underscore the importance of recognizing WCH to avoid unnecessary delays or cancellations of surgeries and to implement appropriate management strategies that can enhance patient outcomes. Methodology This cross-sectional study assesses the prevalence of WCH among surgical patients at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. The study was carried out at the preoperative assessment clinic, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from April 1, 2024, to September 30, 2024. One hundred and fifty patients were enrolled. All patients aged 18 to 75 years, of either gender, scheduled to undergo elective surgery were included. Blood pressure was measured as a routine by the preoperative assessment clinic staff using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer using accurate cuff sizes. Patients were instructed to monitor their ambulatory blood pressure at home. They were asked to maintain a detailed blood pressure chart, recording the date, time, and blood pressure values. This chart was reviewed by the research team on the day of surgery and used for comparison with clinic readings to assess for WCH.  Results The prevalence of WCH was 41.3% (n=62). Female (n=43) patients comprised a greater proportion (70%) of the total WCH cases. Around 33.3% patients were only those who presented a previous history of hospital admission, while 66.7% were those having primary admission. The most prevalent WCH was found in tumor excision cases (53.6%), followed by the renal surgery group (45.2%), then neurosurgery cases (42.5%). It was observed that there was an increased blood pressure range of ambulant daytime systolic and diastolic values in WCH cases in comparison to nighttime values. There was a significantly higher number of cases that had to wait longer before surgery in the preoperative holding area (p=0.002).  Conclusion The prevalence of WCH is significant among surgical patients. Early diagnosis and prompt management could reduce complications and the cancellation rate as well. All these findings emphasized the need to differentiate between essential hypertension and WCH, and once it is identified, it should be treated for a better outcome and to avoid case cancellation. Additionally, WCH has been associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular mortality compared to prehypertension. Recommendations support the use of non-pharmacological interventions for mild to moderate white coat hypertension (WCH), while pharmacological treatment may be considered in more severe cases. This approach differs from the management of essential hypertension.

The optimal surgical strategy for managing odontoid fractures in geriatric populations remains controversial, especially regarding the trade-offs between nonunion risk, perioperative complications, and long-term morbidity. This study aimed to compare postoperative outcomes between anterior odontoid fixation and posterior C1-C2 fusion approaches in older adults. Using the TriNetX Diamond Network, we retrospectively identified patients aged ≥65 years who underwent anterior vs posterior cervical fixation for odontoid fractures from 2007 to 2023. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to control for baseline characteristics across 23 variables, yielding two cohorts of 715 patients each. Outcomes were assessed at 90 days and 1-year, including opioid utilization, mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), surgical site infection (SSI), and hardware complications. Anterior fixation was associated with significantly lower rates of opioid utilization at both 90 days (RR 0.85, 95 % CI 0.796-0.901; p < 0.05) and 1-year (RR 0.867, 95 % CI 0.818-0.919; p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in rates of MI, DVT/PE, SSI, hardware complications, or mortality between groups. Among geriatric patients with odontoid fractures, anterior fixation was associated with lower opioid consumption at 90 days and 1-year postoperatively. Other complication rates were comparable, suggesting that surgical approach can be tailored to patient anatomy and surgeon preference without compromising safety.

Among singleton live births resulting from donor oocyte cycles, do perinatal outcomes differ between single (SET) and double embryo transfers (DET)? We utilized a retrospective cohort of 610 recipients who had a singleton livebirth following nonidentified vitrified donor oocyte IVF cycle from a fertility clinic in the southeast US, 2008-2016. Perinatal outcomes included gestational age and birth weight. Preterm birth was defined as <37 weeks and low birth weight was defined as <2500 grams. Cluster weighted generalized estimating equations were used to calculate effect estimates adjusted for year, embryo stage, prior donor transfers, recipient and donor age, recipient and donor body mass index, and infertility diagnosis. Among the 698 singleton live births, 482 (69 %) were the result of a SET while 216 (31 %) were the result of a DET. Women who had two embryos transferred, as compared with one, did not have a statistically significant difference in gestational age (adjusted mean difference [AMD]:0.23 weeks, 95 % confidence interval [CI]:0.63, 0.17) or birth weight (AMD:27.9 grams, 95 % CI:137.7, 81.9). Similar, non-significant results were observed when evaluating risk of preterm birth and low birthweight. We did not observe an adverse impact of DET on gestational age or birthweight compared to SET in singleton live births from donor cycles. While reassuring, clinicians should continue to use SET in donor oocyte recipients to reduce the adverse impact of multiple pregnancy and all the associated adverse birth outcomes.

Patients with acute pancreatitis show reduced gut microbiome diversity and high abundance of pathogenic bacteria compared with healthy subjects. Admission microbiome profiles are increasingly linked to severity, but methodology and study quality hamper interpretation. Our aim was to investigate whether admission microbiome analysis provides robust and reproducible associations with severity and complications of acute pancreatitis. Patients with acute pancreatitis were prospectively enrolled from 20 Dutch hospitals (2019-2022). Admission saliva and rectal samples from 276 patients underwent 16S rDNA sequencing for microbiome profiling. Subgroups were defined based on a literature search. The microbiota endpoints (alpha- and beta-diversity, and genus abundance) were compared across subgroups and with previous studies. Robustness of the significant associations was classified as 'moderate' or 'high' in case of statistical significance in, respectively, 2 or ≥3 differential abundance models. Rectal alpha diversity (Shannon Index 3.55 vs 3.63, p=0.026) was decreased in necrotising (n=49) versus oedematous pancreatitis (n=218). Microbiota communities of either saliva or rectal samples differed in all the subgroups. In total, 270 (rectal) and 138 (saliva) genera were associated with severity or complications, of which 35 and 3 (Anaeroglobus and Finegoldia in saliva; Lachnospiraceae_FE2018_group in rectal) were classified as, respectively, moderately and highly robust. Fourteen associations were previously reported, of which 10 were in the opposite direction compared with this study. Three admission microbiome taxa associated with severity and complications were highly robust, although their biological relevance remains unclear. This study also shows the lack of replicable findings of admission microbiome associations, highlighting the need for longitudinal studies to establish temporal relationships between microbiome changes and disease progression.

Relative hypothermia is associated with tau accumulation. Furthermore, elucidating the association with changes in brain structure may be useful for the early detection and prevention of dementia. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between relative hypothermia and brain volume, especially gray matter and white matter, and to determine the cutoff point of relative hypothermia associated with brain structure. Cross-sectional. The study included 101 community-dwelling older adults aged 60 to 90 years. Relative hypothermia was defined as the percentage of time during the daytime active phase when body skin temperature, measured by a wearable device, was below the 24-hour average. Brain volume was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging, with gray matter atrophy and total white matter volume quantified. Multiple linear regression analysis examined associations between relative hypothermia and brain volume, while receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves determined cutoff points. Among 101 participants (mean age: 73.5 years; 48.5% female), relative hypothermia was significantly associated with gray matter atrophy (P < .05). The ROC analysis identified a significant cutoff point of ≥61.39% (area under the curve 0.763, P < .001). Relative hypothermia above this threshold (≥61.39%) was strongly associated with gray matter atrophy (OR, 3.98; 95% CI, 4.11-4.99; P < .001). Relative hypothermia is a strong marker of gray matter atrophy. A threshold of 61.39% or higher may serve as an early indicator of structural brain changes, contributing to dementia detection.

Most individuals with moderate-to-severe diffuse axonal injury (DAI) have impaired verbal fluency (VF) capacity. Still, the relationship between brain and VF recovery post-DAI has remained mostly unknown. The aim was to assess brain changes in 13 cortical thickness regions of interest (ROIs), fractional anisotropy (FA), and free water (FW) in three language-related tracts; the VF performance at 6 and 12 months after the DAI; and whether brain changes from 3 to 6 months predict VF performance from 6- to 12-month post-DAI. Twenty-one adults with moderate and severe DAI were analyzed. Structural and diffusion data were acquired on a 3T system 3 and 6 months after the injury. The differences in cortical thickness, FA, and FW values over time were analyzed as factors for the phonemic and semantic VF scores between the 6th and 12th months following the DAI. All analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons. Cortical thickness increased over time in 7 of the 13 ROIs in the right hemisphere and 5 of the 13 ROIs in the left hemisphere. There was an increase in FA in the right arcuate fasciculus and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus over time. An increase in phonemic VF scores was detected between 6 and 12 months post-traumatic brain injury, but not in semantic VF scores over time. Cortical thickness changes in the left posterior inferior frontal pars opercularis and left anterior superior temporal sulcus from 3 to 6 months were associated with improved phonemic VF scores over time. There was no association between diffusion magnetic resonance imaging metrics and VF scores. Our findings suggest that brain plasticity plays a significant role in the initial year following traumatic brain injury, as evidenced by increased cortical thickness and white matter integrity. Improved VF is associated with increased thickness in cortical motor regions responsible for speech performance. However, a larger sample size is needed to confirm these findings.

This study aims to develop a prediction model for invasive metastasis of primary liver cancer based on serum extracellular matrix metalloproteinase-inducing factor (CD147) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Between July 2022 and August 2024, 170 surgically treated primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients at our hospital were recruited. They were divided into a training group (n = 120) and a validation group (n = 50) at a 7:3 ratio. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied in the training group to identify factors related to invasive metastasis. A risk factor-based bar chart prediction model was then constructed and internally tested. Its goodness of fit was evaluated, and the model's diagnostic efficacy was assessed using the ROC curve. Finally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to evaluate the model's clinical value. In the training group, compared with the noninvasive metastasis group, patients in the invasive metastasis group had a significantly lower percentage of intact envelope and tumor size ≥5 cm, and significantly higher serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR), oncoglobulin (CEA), CD147, and IL-6 levels (all p < 0.05). After logistic multifactorial analysis, intact envelope, tumor > 5 cm, AFP, CAR, CD147, and IL-6 were identified as independent influencing factors for invasive metastasis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (all p < 0.05). A column chart model was constructed. The C-index of the training and validation groups was 0.884 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.738-0.932) and 0.841 (95% CI: 0.741-0.939), respectively. The calibration curves showed good agreement between the predicted probability and the actual probability in both the training and validation groups, without significant deviation. The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC analysis was 0.852 (95% CI: 0.824-0.979) and 0.839 (95% CI: 0.791-0.912), respectively. DCA indicated that the model had clinical application value within a certain range of threshold probabilities. The prediction model based on serum CD147, IL-6, and other risk factors for the invasion and metastasis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma demonstrates high diagnostic value.

Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS) are a group of inherited disorders characterised by fatigable muscle weakness. There are currently no validated outcome measures in CMS. We conducted a prospective exploratory observational study in 49 CMS patients. The primary aim was to explore relevant and reliable outcome measures for assessing and monitoring change. Assessments included Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score, Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living, six-minute-walk-test and sit to stand in one minute, in addition to others. Patients were seen 2-4 times over a 2-year period. Median age was 25.5 (range 1-72) years. Subtypes included AChR-deficiency (n = 15), AGRN-DOK7 clustering complex (n = 15), RAPSN (n = 6), COLQ (n = 5), others (n = 8). Ptosis was highest in AChR-deficiency and limb fatigue was highest in AGRN-DOK7 and COLQ. Median sit to stand in one minute was 22 (range 6-45), median total distance walked in six-minute-walk-test was 434 metres (range 0-711 m). A correlation was noted between sit to stand and six-minute-walk-test (R² = 0.291, p-value <0.001) and between total Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis and Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living scores (R² = 0.2851, p-value <0.001). This is the first study exploring the use of outcome measures in a CMS population, highlighting the variability in fatigue across CMS subtypes and the limitations of outcome measures validated in myasthenia gravis for CMS.

In this paper, we introduce a coarse-grained model of polymer crystallization using a multiphase-field approach. The model combines a multiphase-field method, Nakamura's kinetic equation, and the equation of heat conduction for studying microstructural evolution of crystallization under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. The multiphase-field method provides flexibility in adding any number of phases with different properties making the model effective in studying blends or composite materials. We apply our model to systems of neat PA6 and study the impact of initial distribution of crystalline grains and cooling rate on the morphology of the system. The relative crystallinity (conversion) curves show qualitative agreement with experimental data. We also investigate the impact of including carbon fibers on the crystallization and grain morphology. We observe a more homogeneous crystal morphology around fibers. This is associated with the higher initial volume fraction of crystal grains and higher heat conductivity of the fiber (compared to the polymer matrix). Additionally, we observe that the crystalline grains at the fiber surface grow perpendicular to the surface. This indicates that the vertical growth observed in experiments is merely due to geometrical constraints imposed by the fiber surface and neighbouring crystalline regions.

Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) adversely affects cancer survivors' academic, occupational, and psychosocial functioning. Analyzing the National Institutes of Health (NIH) portfolio of funded research provides insight into current efforts, trends, and gaps in CRCI research. We queried the internal NIH iSearch database to identify awards focused on CRCI. A total of 185 grants met inclusion criteria. Data were extracted from grant specific aims and methods. Awards were characterized by research stage (preclinical, clinical), cancer types, and treatments. Preclinical studies were coded for model type and cognitive assessments. Clinical studies were coded for trial design, inclusion criteria, cognitive outcomes, and biomarkers. Of 185 grants, 67% involved clinical, 30% preclinical, and 3% both human and animal studies. Commonly studied cancer types were breast (31%), central nervous system (25%), and hematological (22%). Chemotherapy (34%) and radiotherapy (23%) were the most examined therapies, while biologic (8%) and hormonal (6%) therapies were less frequently studied. Among 130 clinical studies, 64% had observational and 38% had interventional components. The 48 interventional studies focused on behavioral/complementary (73%), pharmacologic (25%), and/or device (10%) interventions. Most clinical studies assessed cognition with objective (88%) and patient-reported outcomes (76%) measures. Significant gaps persist in CRCI research related to high-incidence cancers such as prostate, lung, and colorectal, as well as in studies of emerging treatments like immunotherapy and hormonal therapy. Findings highlight unmet needs and opportunities to advance mechanistic and interventional research that supports cognitive health and quality of life for all cancer survivors.

The impact of state anxiety on conflict control and its neural mechanisms, particularly in relation to proactive versus reactive control, remains incompletely understood. Therefore, we conducted two experiments to investigate how state anxiety affects conflict control across different control contexts and to explore the associated temporal dynamics. The threat of shock paradigm was employed to induce state anxiety. Participants completed the Stroop task under alternating safe and threat states, while EEG data were recorded. In Experiment 1, equal proportions of congruent and incongruent trials were used to create a balanced context. Experiment 2 manipulated trial proportions to induce either proactive or reactive control contexts. Significantly higher subjective anxiety ratings and startle reflexes in the threat state confirmed the successful induction of state anxiety in both experiments. Key findings revealed that in the balanced context, state anxiety enhanced conflict resolution efficiency, manifested by shortened reaction times and decreased sustained potential (SP) amplitudes for incongruent trials under the threat state. In the reactive control context, state anxiety impaired conflict monitoring efficiency, as evidenced by reduced N450 difference waves (incongruent minus congruent trials) under the threat state. This reduction was primarily driven by enhanced N450 amplitudes in congruent trials. Furthermore, enlarged SP difference waves were observed, indicating compensatory recruitment of additional cognitive resources to counteract the impaired monitoring process. Conversely, in the proactive control context, neither behavioral nor neural indicators were affected by state anxiety. These results demonstrate that the impact of state anxiety on conflict control depends critically on the control mode engaged by the task context, offering novel insights into the complex relationship between anxiety and cognitive control.

"Metastatic malignancies to pancreas are extremely rare with most common origins being kidney and melanoma. This study aims to evaluate types of solid malignant metastasis in pancreatic FNAs at our institution along with comprehensive review of reported literature. Our laboratory information system was queried over years 2000-2024 to identify all pancreatic FNAs with metastasis. ""Positive for Malignant Cells"" diagnosis was included in our review. ""Atypical"" or ""Suspicious for malignancy"" were excluded. Type of metastatic malignancy, location and presence of synchronous metastasis were documented. Our results show that out of 4051 pancreatic FNAs with ""Positive for Malignant Cells"", 83 (2 %) cases were metastatic, while remaining 127 cases represented primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas or neuroendocrine tumors. 43 (52 %) renal cell carcinomas, 15 lung carcinomas (17.6 %), 7 skin melanoma (8.2 %),4 breast ductal adenocarcinoma (4.7 %), 3 urothelial carcinomas (3.5 %), 2 leiomyosarcoma (2.4 %), 2 ovarian serous carcinoma (2.4 %),1 uterine adenocarcinoma (1.2 %),1 prostatic carcinoma (1.2 %), 1 skin Merkel-cell carcinoma (1.2 %),1 gastric adenocarcinoma (1.2 %),1 colorectal adenocarcinoma (1.2 %), and 1 vulvar Squamous-cell carcinoma (1.2 %) were identified. Majority (~59 %) of tumors had synchronous presentation. Most common synchronous organs were lungs, liver, and mesenteric lymph nodes. In conclusion, our study demonstrated further support for lung being the second most common primary site of pancreatic metastasis. Renal origin is the most common secondary tumor in our institutional review, followed by combination of lung, breast, and melanoma. Sarcomas can rarely present as pancreatic metastasis, and thorough clinical and histomorphology correlation is warranted. Origin-specific immunostains and molecular testing may help in challenging secondary pancreatic tumors."

Little is known about transgender and gender expansive (TGE) adolescents' and young adults' (AYAs') pain and psychosocial experiences in the acute postsurgical period following gender-affirming surgery (GAS). This study describes pain symptomatology and psychosocial functioning within 1 month after GAS among TGE AYAs, examines immediate postsurgical associations of cannabis use with pain symptomatology, pain catastrophizing, and psychosocial functioning, and explores pain persistence, cannabis use, and psychosocial functioning in a subgroup of individuals 6 months after surgery. AYAs (N = 64) underwent GAS at a large academic medical center in the Pacific Northwest between March 2019 and June 2023. Participants reported on pain intensity, pain interference, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, and cannabis use. Independent and paired-samples t-tests examined differences by age, past 30-day cannabis use, and from the postsurgical period to 6-month follow-up. Participants reported acute and persistent pain following GAS. Younger age was associated with improved pain interference in the postoperative stage. Reports of past 30-day cannabis use were high in this sample, and cannabis use was associated with higher pain interference, anxiety, and depression. This study is the first to assess AYA pain functioning, mental health, and cannabis use following GAS within 1 month of surgery and at 6 months. Findings suggest that 6 months after GAS is a postsurgical adjustment phase, necessitating more supportive perioperative and psychosocial resources, including attention to substance use, during this crucial window.

Small CDR-SB differences at the end of a trial often lead to controversy in deriving clinically meaningful interpretations. We estimated progression-free time (PFT) participants remained at each 0.5 unit CDR-SB increment in dominantly inherited AD (DIAD) and sporadic AD populations, evaluating its potential as an alternative measure of treatment effects. PFT is longer at CDR-SB ≤ 2.0 (1-2 years) and shorter at CDR-SB ≥ 5 (≤ 0.33) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. The DIAD cohort showed similar but shorter times. Using PFT, continuous lecanemab treatment for 3 years is estimated to delay disease progression by 0.62 years in the sporadic population. PFT provides a benchmark for expressing clinical progression and treatment effects and can be applied particularly during open-label extensions and single-arm trials without placebo comparisons. We estimated the progression-free time at each 0.5 unit Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes increment in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (AD) and sporadic AD populations. We proposed using progression-free time to estimate treatment effects in open-label extension or single-arm studies. If further validated, progression-free time could serve as a benchmark for assessing clinical progression and treatment effects.

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is crucial for metabolising thiopurine drugs. This study aimed to establish the cutoff values for TPMT activity in a cohort of healthy individuals. We defined normal TPMT activity ranges and identified clinically applicable thresholds to distinguish individuals with normal TPMT function from those with reduced or deficient activity. A total of 457 participants, including 207 children and 250 healthy adults without prior thiopurine drug exposure, were enrolled. TPMT activity was measured and common defective genetic variants (TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B, and TPMT*3C) were detected. To determine TPMT activity cutoff values and maximize sensitivity and specificity, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was employed. The cutoff values for TPMT activity in children were ≥52.9 nmol 6-MMP/g Hb/h for persons of the wild type and <52.9 nmol 6-MMP/g Hb/h for individuals who were heterozygous. In adults, the cutoff values were ≥44.6, 31.58-44.5, and <31.58 nmol 6-MMP/g Hb/h for wild-type, heterozygous, and compound heterozygous individuals, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 79.29% and 100% in children, whereas, in adults, they were 61.86% and 78.57%, 38.46% and 64.73%, 100% and 95.98% in the wild-type, heterozygous, and compound heterozygous, respectively. Identifying TPMT activity cutoff values is crucial for managing patients receiving thiopurine therapy, especially in Thailand. This approach allows for personalized treatment plans and minimizes the risk of adverse drug reactions. Since TPMT activity cutoff values can differ by population and testing methods, it is important to establish specific cutoff values locally.
40901182	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article;Review	Efficacy of isokinetic in the management of patellofemoral pain syndrome: a narrative review.	Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common musculoskeletal condition that significantly impacts physical function and quality of life. This review evaluates the role of isokinetic knee strengthening exercises in the management of PFPS, highlighting key findings from recent studies. Isokinetic strengthening, particularly focused on eccentric quadriceps contractions, has shown significant improvements in pain reduction, functional performance, and quadriceps strength. Notably, studies demonstrate enhanced outcomes in PFPS patients with bilateral symptoms, as well as in specific populations such as overweight/obese individuals. Despite these benefits, the evidence suggests that isokinetic exercises alone may not fully maintain functional performance, indicating the need for multimodal rehabilitation strategies like eccentric isometric training that can be combined with closed chain exercises (e.g., squats) to enhance functional transfer. Additionally, isokinetic protocols show promise in addressing impaired proprioception and neuromuscular control, particularly in patients with overexertion-related symptoms. Future research should explore the long-term efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and mechanistic underpinnings of isokinetic training to further refine treatment approaches and enhance clinical outcomes.

Thoracic surgery is known to lead to post-operative opioid dependence in countries with high opioid consumption; however, there are limited reports from countries with moderate to low opioid consumption, such as Japan. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for persistent opioid use after thoracic surgery in Japan. A retrospective cohort study using linked medical claims data from the National Health Insurance in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. Patients aged ≥18 who underwent thoracic (mediastinal or lung) surgery between October 2012 and September 2021 were included in this study. Persistent opioid use was defined as prescription from 0 to 14 days after surgery and 91 to 180 days after surgery. We evaluated associated factors using multivariable logistic regressions. Among the 6,041 patients who underwent thoracic surgery during the study period, 3,924 were included in the final analysis. The median age was 68 years (range, 64-71 years), and 2,316 (61.0 percent) were male. Persistent opioid use was recorded in 130 (3.3 percent). Multivariable analyses identified neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.09-3.77; p = 0.027) and thoracotomy (vs video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) (OR, 1.50; 95 percent CI, 1.01-2.24; p = 0.046) as independent risk factors for persistent opioid use. In a prefecture of Japan, 3.3 percent of patients who underwent thoracic surgery developed persistent opioid use. Neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) and thoracotomy were independent factors associated with persistent opioid use. Individualized perioperative pain management strategies should be considered for high-risk patients.

Physical Activity (PA) is important for mental, physical, and brain health. Adolescence is marked by increased engagement in risky substance use (SU) behaviors, which can negatively affect brain development. This study aims to determine if PA influences SU experimentation and initiation among adolescents. We predicted higher levels of PA would be associated with less SU, with a larger effect in more vigorous compared to light PA. A sample of 2541 participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study provided three weeks of Fitbit-measured PA data at the 2-year follow-up, and SU outcomes at the 3- and 4-year follow-up. SU outcomes of experimentation (i.e., sip/puff/try of alcohol, nicotine, or cannabis) and initiation (i.e., full drink of alcohol, more than a puff/try of nicotine or cannabis, or anything else) were examined dichotomously (i.e., yes/no). Logistic regression analyses were conducted, controlling for demographics, externalizing, and depressive symptoms endorsed on Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Total PA was associated with 24 % decreased odds in SU initiation (OR 0.82, 95 % CI 0.69-0.99, p < .05). After examining PA intensities more closely, light PA predicted 26 % decreased odds of SU initiation (OR 0.73, 95 % CI 0.61-0.88, p = .001). No significant associations emerged between PA and experimentation, or moderate and vigorous PA and initiation. More engagement in total and light PA reduced the odds of SU initiation, suggesting that low-intensity activity, not moderate or vigorous PA, may provide protection against adolescent SU. Future research should examine underlying mechanisms and contextual factors that account for these results.

Accurate prediction of hospital length of stay (LoS) is a vital component in optimizing clinical workflows, resource allocation, and patient care. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning models for both binary and multi-class LoS classification tasks using structured clinical variables, physiological measurements, and unstructured clinical notes. Seven data configurations were constructed from combinations of structured features (Z), including diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests, and microbiology results; MeSH-based symptoms (S); physiological signals (F); and textual representations (E): Z, F, E, ZS, ZSF, ZSE, and ZSEF. Five predictive models-Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-were applied, with and without feature selection, where categorical features and Bag-of-Words representations were reduced to varied dimensions. Results indicate that the base structured feature set (Z) alone yields strong predictive performance across tasks. Moreover, the integration of additional data types-S, F, and E-either individually or in combination, consistently enhanced performance, with the ZSEF configuration achieving the highest F1-scores and AUC values in most cases. While the application of SMOTE did not yield substantial improvements in the global setting encompassing all hospital admissions, it demonstrated enhanced performance in disease-specific cohorts, particularly for patients admitted with lung cancer. Among the evaluated models, XGBoost and ANN demonstrated superior generalizability. These findings underscore the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and feature reduction techniques in advancing predictive modeling for hospital length of stay across diverse patient populations.

Obesity is a pervasive global health issue frequently associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Limited data exist regarding the impact of MetS and its individual components on pulmonary function in obese pediatric populations. This study investigated the relationship between MetS and lung function, and further identified specific MetS components that adversely affect pulmonary outcomes. We enrolled obese children and adolescents aged 7‒18 years. Anthropometric measurements and metabolic assessments were performed. All participants underwent spirometry and the six-minute walk test (6-MWT). Based on MetS criteria, participants were classified into MetS or non-MetS groups. Between-group comparisons were conducted, and regression analyses were used to identify MetS components predictive of lung function and exercise capacity. A total of 155 participants were evaluated (37 [23.9%] with MetS; 118 [76.1%] without). Those with MetS demonstrated a significantly lower 6-MWT distance z-score (‒0.61 ± 1.1 vs ‒0.07 ± 0.99; P = 0.006). No significant group differences were found in spirometric parameters. Obesity indices exerted a stronger negative effect on lung function than MetS status. Abdominal circumference (b = ‒0.03, P < 0.001) and elevated FBS (> 100 mg/dL; b = ‒0.50, P = 0.04) were associated with reduced 6-MWT distance z-scores; they also negatively influenced FEV1% predicted (abdominal circumference: b = ‒0.15, P < 0.04; elevated FBS: b = ‒9.04, P = 0.02). Obese children and adolescents with MetS show significantly diminished functional capacity as evidenced by lower 6-MWT performance. Among MetS components, increased abdominal circumference and elevated FBS (> 100 mg/dL) emerged as critical predictors of decreased functional capacity. • Obesity is associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and is known to impair lung function. • MetS is linked to metabolic and cardiovascular complications, but its impact on pulmonary function in obese pediatric populations remains unclear. • Obese children and adolescents with MetS have significantly lower functional capacity, as demonstrated by reduced six-minute walk test (6-MWT) performance. • Among MetS components, increased abdominal circumference and elevated fasting blood sugar > 100 mg/dL were identified as key predictors of reduced functional capacity and lung function.

The findings provide greater information on the level of refractive errors in Vietnam, which could assist clinicians and relevant stakeholders to identify high-risk groups and prioritise interventions and preventative measures, contributing to more efficient eye care and cost-effective strategies. Vietnam, a developing country in Southeast Asia, has shown an increase in myopia progression in recent years. However, the prevalence of refractive errors across the country is unclear. The aim of this study was to estimate the pooled prevalence of different refractions in children across Vietnam, and to explore differences between rural and urban areas, and male and female children. A systematic literature search was performed to capture all studies up to April 2024, using online databases including Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL. This was carried out independently by two researchers, following the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024524780). The quality assessment of included studies was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool checklist. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled refractive error prevalence, with robustness evaluated using 95% confidence intervals and sensitivity analyses. 15 school-based studies were identified (children n = 32,211), of which 6 qualified for meta-analysis inclusion (n = 15,825). The pooled refractive error, myopia, and hyperopia prevalences were calculated respectively as 37.60% [95%CI: 27.78-47.43], 28.83% [95%CI: 19.24-38.42], and 0.41% [95%CI: 0.24-0.59] with high heterogeneities of 99%, p<0.01. Refractive error prevalence was greater in urban locations, and female children. This systematic review and meta-analysis of refractive error prevalence in Vietnamese school children indicates a significant presence of refractive error, especially myopia. However, the large interval ranges suggest that further research using a standardised protocol is required to achieve more accurate estimates.

BackgroundHepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) shows promise for treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).PurposeTo compare the efficacy and safety of HAIC versus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), each combined with TKIs, in patients with advanced HCC.Material and MethodsThis retrospective study analyzed 86 patients with unresectable HCC, predominantly Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B/C and with well-preserved liver function, treated at a tertiary medical center between January 2019 and December 2022. Patients were assigned to either the HAIC + TKI group (n = 40) or the TACE + TKI group (n = 46) based on multidisciplinary team recommendations, considering tumor burden, vascular invasion, and patient preference. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were recorded.ResultsThe median OS was 13.7 months in the HAIC group and 8.3 months in the TACE group (hazard ratio = 0.5489, 95% confidence interval = 0.3557-0.8472; P = 0.00661). The most frequent grade 3/4 AEs were elevated ALT (15.0% vs. 39.1%), elevated AST (17.5% vs. 34.8%), and abdominal pain (25.0% vs. 28.3%), with only ALT showing significant between-group difference. All AEs were manageable, with no treatment-related deaths.ConclusionIn a cohort of patients with unresectable HCC, primarily BCLC stage B/C, and preserved liver function, HAIC combined with TKIs offers superior survival and tumor control compared to TACE + TKIs in unresectable HCC, with acceptable safety. Prospective multicenter trials are needed to validate these findings and further optimize treatment strategies.

Select patients with metastatic clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma can be treated without systemic therapy, yet few studies have explored this population. We investigated the efficacy of metastasis-directed therapy without systemic therapy in oligometastatic clear-cell renal-cell carincoma. This investigator-initiated single-arm, phase 2 trial enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, histologically confirmed clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma, and one to five metastases. Patients remained off systemic therapy and underwent metastasis-directed therapy to all disease sites, with additional metastasis-directed therapy for limited progression. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in the per-protocol population (patients who received radiation to at least one metastatic lesion during their initial local treatment) and systemic therapy-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Progression-free survival was defined as the interval from enrolment to the first instance of disease progression, according to RECIST 1.1, or clinical progression, or death from any cause. Systemic therapy-free survival was defined as time from enrolment to initiation of systemic therapy or death from clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma. A prespecified 24-month median systemic therapy-free survival was the threshold for success. Safety was analysed in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03575611, and is closed to new patient enrolment. Between July 13, 2018, and May 2, 2023, 121 patients were enrolled and included in the intention-to-treat population, of whom 120 received at least one round of definitive radiotherapy and were included in the per-protocol and safety populations. Median follow-up time for the 121 enrolled patients was 36·3 months (IQR 26·5-51·1). Median progression-free survival was 17·7 months (95% CI 14·9-22·4), and median systemic therapy-free survival time was 34·0 months (28·3-54·1). The median and lower bound of 95% CI of the median systemic therapy-free survival time exceeded the prespecified 24-month target. Eight (7%) of 120 patients had grade 3-4 adverse events at least possibly attributable to metastasis-directed therapy. The most common grade 3 event was pain near the treatment site (four events). The single grade 4 event was hyperglycaemia. There were no treatment-related deaths. Select patients with oligometastatic disease can be managed with serial metastasis-directed therapy with prolonged time off systemic therapy, favourable progression-free survival, and limited adverse events.

Exercise training is recommended for all patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Whether exercise training improves liver histology independent of body weight loss remains controversial. Given the increasing reliance on non-invasive biomarkers as a surrogate for liver histology, we investigated the relationship between exercise training and improvement in liver histology using the MASH Resolution Index (MASH-RI), a validated composite score of multiple biomarkers, in a post hoc analysis of the NASHFit trial. This study randomized adults with biopsy-proven MASH to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training or standard of care for 20 weeks. Mediterranean-informed dietary counseling was provided to each group. Change in the MASH-RI was measured and compared between the two groups (n = 23). Applying the MASH-RI, those who performed exercise training achieved MASH resolution nearly three times more often (33% vs. 13%, p < 0.01) versus those who received standard of care. Exercise training improved individual biomarkers included in the MASH-RI, including ALT, AST, and MRI-PDFF. Exercise training leads to MASH resolution, as defined by the MASH-RI at greater rates than standard lifestyle counseling. Future research is needed to determine how best to use the MASH-RI as a therapeutic monitoring tool to gauge response to lifestyle intervention. NCT03518294.

As human skeletal muscle cellular and molecular contractile properties are temperature-sensitive, the ability to perform experiments at body temperature (∼37°C) may lead to a better understanding of their in vivo responses and potentially their effects upon whole-muscle and whole-body performance. We quantified molecular (myosin-actin cross-bridge mechanics and kinetics) and cellular (specific tension; force divided by cross-sectional area) function in slow-contracting myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and fast-contracting MHC IIA fibers from older adults (n=13, 8 female) at 37°C and compared these to results at 25°C. MHC I fibers were more temperature-sensitive than MHC IIA fibers, showing greater increases in cross-bridge kinetics (MHC I: 4.9-8.7x; IIA: 4x) and number or stiffness of strongly-bound cross-bridges (MHC I: 86%; IIA: 34%), leading to increased specific tension in MHC I (19%), with no change in MHC IIA fibers. The expected relationship between fiber force and size (cross-sectional area, CSA) was stronger at 37°C in both fiber types, explaining 80-82% of the variance compared to 51-52% at 25°C. Specific tension was unchanged with size at 37°C in both fiber types, showing that force increases proportionally with CSA, which may be due to the increased number or stiffness of strongly-bound cross-bridges at this temperature. At 25°C, specific tension decreased with size in agreement with previous experiments. Overall, MHC I and IIA fibers at body temperature (37°C) became more analogous, including similar specific tension and closer cross-bridge kinetics, and force production was more strongly correlated with fiber size compared to a non-physiological temperature. Although skeletal muscle function is highly sensitive to temperature, human single fiber studies have only been conducted at ≤30°C.Small-amplitude sinusoidal perturbations were utilized to elucidate mechanisms of single fiber force production at human physiological temperature (37°C).We found that functional differences in slow-contracting myosin heavy chain (MHC I) and fast-contracting MHC IIA fibers observed at 25°C were less apparent at 37°C, as force, crossbridge kinetics, and strongly-bound crossbridges increased more in MHC I fibers than MHC IIA fibers at 37 vs. 25°C. These results indicate that, given the different sensitivity of each fiber type to changes in temperature, functional assessments of muscle should be conducted at 37°C to better translate to vivo conditions.

Blue light (peak wavelength 442 nm) has been shown to modulate the immune response in preclinical models of intra-abdominal sepsis and pneumonia. In vivo pathways involve optic nerve stimulation with transmission to the central nervous system, activation of parasympathetic pathways terminating at the spleen, and downstream immune effects including decreased inflammatory tissue damage and improved pathogen clearance. Related effects on pain mediators including proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 6, TNF- α) and autonomic tone (increased parasympathetic outflow) suggest possible analgesic properties that would be highly relevant to a trauma population. This is a randomised controlled trial in which adult trauma inpatients (≥18 years) with painful rib fractures will be allocated 1:1:1 to three arms: bright blue light intervention (peak 442 nm, ~1400 lux), bright full-spectrum light comparison (~1400 lux) and usual ambient light control. Bright light exposures will be administered for 4 consecutive hours daily for up to 3 days. The primary outcome will be any measurable changes in chest wall pain intensity during deep breathing, quantified using an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes will assess chest wall pain intensity at rest, opioid requirements, delirium incidence, pulmonary complication incidence, hospital-free and intensive care unit-free days, and physiological markers of autonomic nervous system, circadian, and immune activation. Sample size analysis yields a total of 75 participants needed to detect a 2-point difference in pain scores with >80% power and assuming a 20% non-completion rate. Full ethical approval for this trial has been granted by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. On study completion, results will be published in the peer-reviewed literature and at ClinicalTrials.gov. NCT06626334.

Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) individuals have increased risk of noncardiac comorbidities including cancer and infections. Whether they are at increased risk of autoimmunity is unknown. The purpose of this study was to understand the association of ACHD and risk for autoimmunity. A case-control study was performed using All of Us, a nationwide biomedical database. In 2024, we queried autoimmune conditions and ACHD individuals ≥18 year of age with congenital heart disease (CHD) diagnoses determined using SNOMED, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9-CM, and ICD-100-CM classifications. ACHD individuals were matched 1:20 to controls for age, race, sex, smoking, and obesity. We examined subcategories of mild/moderate/severe CHD. Among 287,012 participants, 2941 ACHD (1.02%) individuals (mean age 62 years, 55.3% female) were identified. ACHD individuals had increased odds of autoimmunity (OR: 1.95; P < 0.05), both systemic (OR: 1.94; P < 0.05) and organ specific (OR: 1.54; P < 0.05) conditions. Sixty-nine percent had sufficient detail to be classified into mild/moderate/severe CHD; severe group was smaller and younger (n = 162, mean age = 47.6 years) compared to mild (n = 1169, mean age = 63.8) and moderate (n = 703, mean age = 61.8 years) groups. Mild and moderate CHD were associated with autoimmunity (OR: 1.93; P < 0.05 and OR: 1.56; P < 0.05, respectively). The entire severe CHD group did not show an increase in odds of autoimmunity (OR: 1.45; P = 0.168). When the groups were subdivided by age, severe ACHD individuals ≥60 years did show increased odds of autoimmunity (OR: 2.71; P < 0.05). ACHD individuals showed a nearly 2-fold increased odds of developing autoimmune conditions, both for systemic and organ-specific autoimmunity, which persisted among those with simple/moderate CHD. In an age-related analysis, the severe CHD group ≥60 years has a similar risk.

Variations exist among surgeons in the treatment of recurrent lumbar disc herniation (LDH), generating major issues in decision-making models. The authors aimed to identify international nuances in surgical treatment patterns, highlight the differences in responses in each country group and different treatment trends across countries, and identify factors that influence surgical decisions. An online survey with preformulated answers was submitted to 292 orthopedic surgeons and 223 neurosurgeons from 16 countries regarding 3 clinical vignettes (recurrence without low back pain, recurrence with severe low back pain, and recurrence with 2-level disc disease). The variability for each country was calculated according to the index of qualitative variation (IQV; ranging from 0 [no variability] to 1 [maximum variability]). To integrate the surgeons' perspectives, 2 Likert-type queries were submitted concerning the specific criteria for fusion and overall decision-making for each clinical case. Except for the case of first recurrence with pure radiculopathy without instability or inflammatory disc disease, where the variability was low (mean IQV 0.24, redo discectomy 86.2%), the other cases showed high variability (mean IQV range 0.63-0.71), with frequent proposals for surgery with implants. For countries with low variability, a high rate of posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) procedures (55.3%) and low rates of anterior/combined procedures (5.9%) and posterolateral fusion (4.9%) were observed. For countries with high variability, a lower rate of PLIF/TLIF procedures was observed (33.1%), with alternate proposals for anterior/combined procedures (20.8%) and posterolateral fusion without interbody fusion (12.8%). Orthopedic surgeons performed significantly more procedures with implants compared with neurosurgeons (p < 0.01). Age, practice type, and the annual number of surgery cases did not play a significant role in the choice of procedures. The most important criteria for fusion were lumbar pain symptoms associated with radiculopathy (77.9% strongly agreed) and the existence of inflammatory disc disease (73.0%). Furthermore, 62.1% of the respondents strongly agreed with performing fusion for all second recurrences. For the final decision, surgeons agreed with following the literature (81.9%), selecting low-morbidity procedures (78.6%), and using a familiar technique (78.6%). Patient preference was an important and/or very important decision factor for 64.1% of respondents. Significant differences existed between spine surgeons in the surgical treatment of recurrent LDH. Intra- and intergroup variations were observed, reflecting the lack of consensus in the literature and the challenge of adapting differences in habits and training to the few existing guidelines.

In this study, the effects of operating temperature on pore-scale gas bubble transport in a carbon-based anode porous transport layer (PTL) of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer is revealed using operando X-ray computed tomography (CT). Higher temperature operation (80 °C compared to 40 °C) led to a lower total gas bubble volume fraction in the PTL (0.25 to 0.17; 32% lower), which is attributed to improved water transport and gas removal. Higher temperatures led to fewer bubbles in the PTL (13% less at 80 °C compared to 40 °C) as well as a greater occurrence of smaller bubbles (35% increase in skewness of the bubble size distribution), and this behavior is attributed to faster rates of nucleation and bubble detachment from the electrode. The formation of gas slugs is also observed in the anode channels at 60 °C and 80 °C, which is attributed to the faster detachment and coalescence of bubbles from the PTL/flow field interface.

Stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) often remains undiagnosed until more severe symptoms appear. This study assessed awareness and management of CKD among Italian general practitioners (GPs), focusing on early detection and current practices. A nation-wide, retrospective observational study was conducted using data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN®) database. Each participant was required to have had at least one interaction with a GP for either medical or administrative purposes (considering the index date), and to have a minimum of three years of retrospective data available  from January 2021 to June 2022. The study evaluated the proportion of individuals aged ≥ 40 years who underwent a second serum creatinine test after ≥ 90 days, referrals to nephrologists, and CKD diagnosis confirmation and categorization. Multivariable Poisson regression models analyzed data to identify associations between patient characteristics and outcomes, in both the overall cohort and in the sub-group with available urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) measurement. Among 347,548 adults aged ≥ 40 years, 18,002 (5.2%) had an initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) indicating possible stage 3 CKD (30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 1495 of these had a concomitant uACR assessment. Data concerning follow-up testing and specialist referrals were inconsistent, and available only for 53.0% and 9.0% of the patients, respectively. Overall, 15.3% met the criteria for KDIGO stage 3 CKD, yet CKD ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes were recorded for only 905 (5.0%) patients. Factors associated with these outcomes were analyzed, including age, comorbidities, treatments, and laboratory values. Substantial gaps in GP awareness and adherence to CKD management guidelines were identified, particularly in follow-up testing, referral practices, and diagnostic coding. Targeted educational interventions and standardized care protocols are needed to enhance CKD detection and management in primary care, improving patient outcomes and healthcare system performance.
40917768	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Cognitive screening and education: assessing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment's validity in older Ugandan populations.	Cognitive screening tools such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are widely used to detect cognitive impairments. However, their accuracy in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may be affected by variations in educational levels. This study examined the impact of educational attainment on MoCA performance in older Ugandan adults, considering sex- and age-related differences. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Wakiso District, Uganda, involving adults aged ≥ 65 years. Their MoCA scores were analyzed in relation to their educational attainment, sex, and age. Multiple linear regression models were used to determine the independent effect of education on cognitive performance after adjusting for age and sex. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using multiple imputations for missing data. Higher educational attainment was significantly associated with a better MoCA performance (β = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.22-2.24, p < 0.001). Age was negatively associated with MoCA scores (β = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.19 to -0.07, p < 0.001), whereas male sex was positively associated (β = 1.89, 95% CI: 0.56-3.22, p = 0.005). The interaction terms (education × sex and education × age) were not significant, indicating that the effect of education was consistent across demographic subgroups. The final regression model explained 42.7% of the variance in the MoCA scores (adjusted R2 = 0.43, p < 0.001). The sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the findings. Educational attainment impacts MoCA performance in older Ugandans, highlighting the need for region-specific norms and culturally adapted cognitive screening in LMICs.
40917677	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article;Review	Rewiring the seizing brain: stem cell grafts as neuromodulatory architects in epilepsy therapy.	As an emerging therapeutic strategy, stem cell transplantation has demonstrated promising potential in the management of refractory epilepsy. Epilepsy, a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, affects approximately one-third of patients worldwide who exhibit resistance to existing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Consequently, exploring novel treatment modalities is imperative. Recent studies have indicated that stem cell transplantation improves neurological function in epilepsy through multiple mechanisms. Research has revealed that transplanted stem cells mitigate seizure-induced neuronal damage by replacing dead or dysfunctional neurons, secreting beneficial neurotrophic factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF), and releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines. Preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials have shown that stem cell transplantation significantly reduces seizure frequency and enhances patients' quality of life. However, current research is limited by small sample sizes and short-term follow-ups, necessitating further validation of long-term efficacy. Despite its therapeutic promise, stem cell transplantation faces critical challenges. First, technical details such as the cell source, processing, method of transplantation, and timing have yet to be standardized, leading to potential variability in efficacy and safety across different stem cell types. Second, complications like immune rejection and tumorigenesis pose significant safety risks. Future research should focus on optimizing stem cell selection and processing, designing robust clinical trials to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy, exploring combinatorial approaches with existing therapies, and developing advanced biomaterials to enhance transplantation success. Additionally, monitoring post-transplant cell survival and functionality, along with identifying epilepsy-specific biomarkers, will be crucial to refining the precision and safety of stem cell-based therapies.
40864807	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article;Review	Immune Organoids: A Review of Their Applications in Cancer and Autoimmune Disease Immunotherapy.	Immune organoids have emerged as a ground-breaking platform in immunology, offering a physiologically relevant and controllable environment to model human immune responses and evaluate immunotherapeutic strategies. Derived from stem cells or primary tissues, these three-dimensional constructs recapitulate key aspects of lymphoid tissue architecture, cellular diversity, and functional dynamics, providing a more accurate alternative to traditional two-dimensional cultures and animal models. Their ability to mimic complex immune microenvironments has positioned immune organoids at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy development, autoimmune disease modeling, and personalized medicine. This narrative review highlights the advances in immune organoid technology, with a focus on their applications in testing immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, and cancer vaccines. It also explores how immune organoids facilitate the study of autoimmune disease pathogenesis with insights into their molecular basis and support in high-throughput drug screening. Despite their transformative potential, immune organoids face significant challenges, including the replication of systemic immune interactions, standardization of fabrication protocols, scalability limitations, biological heterogeneity, and the absence of vascularization, which restricts organoid size and maturation. Future directions emphasize the integration of immune organoids with multi-organ systems to better replicate systemic physiology, the development of advanced biomaterials that closely mimic lymphoid extracellular matrices, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize organoid production and data analysis, and the rigorous clinical validation of organoid-derived findings. Continued innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential to overcome existing barriers, enabling the widespread adoption of immune organoids as indispensable tools for advancing immunotherapy, vaccine development, and precision medicine.

Background: ICU infection control link nurses play a vital role in preventing healthcare-associated infections. However, a few studies have focused on their experiences, problems, and additional needs in this role. Objectives: To explore the work experience of ICU infection control link nurses. Methods: This study employed a qualitative research approach using descriptive phenomenology. Between July and September 2024, 12 ICU infection control link nurses were recruited from 12 hospitals in Chongqing, China, through purposive sampling with maximum variation. Semistructured interviews were conducted with these participants. Interview data were analyzed using the Colaizzi method. Results: The work experiences of ICU infection control link nurses can be summarized into 3 themes and 11 subthemes: role cognition and growth (role perception, role identity, and enhancement of personal abilities); perceptions of clinical practice (questioning and affirmation of professional recognition, emergence and resolution of burnout, teamwork issues and improvement measures, insufficient priority of quality control, and unsolvable problems); and work demands (systematic training, hospital support, and qualification recognition and career development). Conclusions: ICU infection control link nurses, serving as the intermediary hub between the intensive care unit and the infection control team, juggling dual responsibilities, are challenging and require a variety of information and support. Implications for Nursing Management: Hospital administrators should understand infection control link nurses' work experiences to implement targeted interventions promoting their work adaptation and motivation, thus reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections.

Background/Objectives: Physical activity (PA) is widely recognized as a beneficial approach to improving the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of breast cancer survivors. This study explored key research topics and emerging trends in studies related to PA and HRQoL among breast cancer survivors. Methods: Titles and abstracts of 3847 English-language research articles (2000-2024) were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus using keywords related to 'breast cancer', 'PA/exercise', and 'HRQoL'. A text-mining algorithm based on the Dirichlet-multinomial regression approach in Python was applied to identify the top 10 research topics and their trends over time. Results: In total, 10 key topics emerged: (1) Quality of Life and Well-being, (2) Cancer Treatment and Health-Related Fitness, (3) Supportive Care and Psychosocial Factors, (4) Survivorship, Palliative Care, and Integrative Medicine, (5) Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviors, (6) Upper Limb-Related Side Effects, (7) Cancer-Related Fatigue and Symptoms, (8) Epidemiological and Clinical Factors, (9) Side Effects of Cancer Treatment, and (10) Weight Management. Among these, Topics 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 followed upward trajectories, while others showed relatively stable trends. Conclusions: Findings highlight that PA research on breast cancer survivors' HRQoL spans all stages of survivorship and considers both clinical outcomes and psychosocial and emotional well-being. Understanding how PA and HRQoL have been represented in research helps clarify which survivor needs have received attention and which remain underexplored. These thematic patterns underscore growing acknowledgement of survivors' lived experiences and offer a roadmap for addressing future research and care gaps.

Acute myeloid leukaemia-normal karyotype (AML-NK) exhibits heterogeneity in expression profiles, influencing the treatment response and survival outcome. Transcriptome sequencing allows a comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and dysregulated pathways in AML-NK, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms and their implications in patients' management. DEG analyses utilising transcriptome sequencing were conducted using a customised DESeq2 pipeline on 51 AML-NK patients at diagnosis (DX), 12 AML-NK patients who attained first remission (CR1) and 12 healthy controls. The transcriptomic sequencing of AML-NK compared to healthy controls revealed 5,126 DEGs, comprising 85.8% coding genes and 14.2% non-coding elements across 37 pathway categories. The AML-NK DX versus CR1 identified 5,621 DEGs consisting of 84.7% coding genes and 15.3% non-coding elements affecting 20 categories of pathways. Gene set enrichment analysis in this study revealed consistent upregulation of proliferative pathways, including cell cycle and DNA replication. In contrast, immune-related pathways, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and MHC antigen presentation pathways, were downregulated. Overexpression of oncogenes (FLT3, MYB, DNMT3B, and MYCN) in DX vs CR1 samples reinforces their usefulness in minimal residual disease monitoring, especially in AML-NK with no genetic aberrations. These findings reiterate the known hallmarks of cancers and validate the transcriptomic dysregulation in the pathogenesis of AML-NK. The robustness of the transcriptome sequencing findings was confirmed by RT-qPCR validation of six genes that were not reported in AML-NK patients. The comprehensive analyses of pathways with dysregulation of a myriad of genes led to an understanding of AML-NK pathogenesis and highlighted the markers for minimal residual disease. In summary, this study performed the first transcriptome-wide analysis of AML-NK in a Malaysian cohort and underscored pathways that are candidates for therapeutic interventions.

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is associated with decreased quadriceps strength and decreased activation of central motor cortex. It is necessary to investigate intervention strategies that combine central and peripheral treatments. To assess the effectiveness of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in conjunction with quadriceps strength training for 12 weeks in the treatment of KOA. Prospective, randomized, single-blind, comparative effectiveness study. In this 12-week randomized controlled clinical trial, 48 eligible patients were randomly allocated to either an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group underwent high-frequency rTMS in conjunction with quadriceps strength training, whereas the control group received sham rTMS alongside quadriceps strength training. The primary outcome measure was the visual analog scale (VAS), while secondary outcome measures included the University of Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the peak torque of the extensor muscles, the peak torque of the flexor muscles, and the flexion-extension ratio. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with group as a group factor and time factor was used to calculate the effects of the interventions on all outcome measures. Forty-four of the 48 patients who were allocated at random finished the study. Twelve weeks later, the VAS index in the experimental group decreased from 3.14 ± 1.13 to 1.36 ± 0.85, and that in the control group decreased from 3.23 ± 1.15 to 2.18 ± 1.40 (p < 0.05). At the same time, the WOMAC score, the peak torque of the extensor muscles, the peak torque of the flexor muscles, and the flexion-extension ratio were improved in the two groups (p < 0.05), and the experimental group was significantly better than the control group (p < 0.05). High-frequency rTMS combined with quadriceps strength training for 12 weeks can effectively improve pain, muscle strength and joint function in patients with KOA.

Guideline-driven de-escalation of the extent of surgery for low-risk thyroid cancer has made treatment decisions more complex. Shared decision-making (SDM) is more involved than informed consent, improves patient satisfaction, and is considered standard of care. Patient decision aids (DA) can facilitate SDM but appropriate resources are lacking. DA development occurred in 3 main phases. First, a prototype DA was developed and refined by a working group (clinicians, behavioral scientists, nurses, and trained consumer). Nationwide clinician consultation sessions obtained mixed-methods feedback leading to a hybrid paper-web DA ready for patient testing. Second, the paper DA was used within clinically appropriate consultations (Bethesda 3-6 thyroid nodules) and patient feedback obtained with the Ottawa acceptability and decisional conflict scales. Three cycles of iterative changes were made to the DA. Patient focus groups led to further refinements. Third, 40 clinicians were invited to review DA materials, providing mixed-methods feedback. Initial clinician consultation sessions (n = 113) revealed that surgeons used information resources more frequently in, and were more satisfied with, their current patient discussions around thyroid cancer management compared with endocrinologists (88% vs. 32% and 95% vs. 46% respectively, p < 0.01 for both). 95% of clinicians were open to using the DA, but concerns regarding availability, appropriateness, flexibility, credibility and potential to lengthen consultations, were raised. Patients reported that the DA was useful (97% paper, 100% web) and sufficient (85% paper, 100% web). Decisional conflict was low (17 paper vs. 12 web). Qualitative feedback led to changes to improve visual appeal, readability and minimize emotive responses. Clinician review of DA (60% response) reported no bias (73% paper, 79% web) and 86% felt the DA would be easily incorporated into practice. We present a hybrid paper and web-DA ready for wider testing in patients with low-risk thyroid cancer to complement SDM regarding the extent of surgery.

The study aims to evaluate the course of implant treatment for congenitally missing lower -second premolars in patients referred to publicly funded specialist care over an 11-year period. This retrospective, register-based cohort study selected patient data on dental implant treatment in the lower second premolar region from 2009 to 2019 (n = 146). After applying exclusion criteria, the final sample included 74 patients. Data on retained deciduous teeth, orthodontic treatment prior to implant placement, and implantation procedures were gathered from patient files. Results were presented using descriptive statistics, t-test, and Chi-square analyses (p < 0.05). The most common orthodontic treatment was space optimization before dental implant placement. Most retained deciduous teeth were extracted between ages 21 and 29, with a median of 6 months before implant placement. Bone grafting was performed at 23% of implant sites. The mean implant diameter was 4.0 mm, and the mean implant length was 9.6 mm. Good primary stability was achieved in all cases. Individually planned orthodontic and surgical treatments are essential in managing congenitally missing lower premolars, particularly when implant placement is indicated. Early diagnosis and collaboration between dental specialists are key elements in the treatment. A multidisciplinary approach ensures optimal space for implant, bone preservation, and optimal implant alignment.

The purpose of this study was to develop a frailty index for pediatric patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion for deformity correction. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Pediatric database was used. Patients <18 years of age who had undergone posterior spinal fusion for the treatment of spinal deformity were included. The outcomes of interest included any adverse events, Clavien-Dindo grade-IV adverse events, mortality, and extended length of stay. Significant variables from the multivariable regression analysis were used to create a frailty index. The frailty index was assessed with use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of each outcome of interest. The frailty index was externally validated with use of a validation cohort. The rates of the outcomes of interest were expressed as proportions and were stratified by the frailty index score. The present study included 34,478 patients (28,377 in the derivation cohort and 6,101 in the validation cohort). The frailty index included severe respiratory disease, gastrointestinal disease, neuromuscular disease, cognitive/developmental delay, seizure disorder, and asthma. In the derivation cohort, the area under the curve (AUC) for any adverse event, a Clavien-Dindo grade-IV adverse event, mortality, and extended length of stay were 0.77, 0.85, 0.91, and 0.79, respectively. On external validation, the AUC for any adverse event, a Clavien-Dindo grade-IV adverse event, mortality, and extended length of stay were 0.72, 0.88, 0.90, 0.78, respectively. An increasing frailty index score was associated with increasing rates of all morbidity and mortality outcomes. The frailty index had good to excellent discrimination for morbidity and mortality. This frailty index allows for better risk stratification and informed decision-making. Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

Oxidative stress induces a wide range of cellular damage, often causing disease and cell death. While many organisms are susceptible to the effects of oxidative stress, haloarchaea have adapted to be highly resistant. Several aspects of the haloarchaeal oxidative stress response have been characterized; however, little is known about the impacts of oxidative stress at the translation level. Using the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii, we performed RNA-seq and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to characterize the global translation landscape during oxidative stress. We identified 281 genes with differential translation efficiency (TE). Downregulated genes were enriched in ribosomal and translation proteins, in addition to peroxidases and genes involved in the TCA cycle. We also identified 42 small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) with ribosome occupancy. Size distributions of ribosome footprints revealed distinct patterns for coding and noncoding genes, with 12 sRNAs matching the pattern of coding genes, and mass spectrometry confirming the presence of seven small proteins encoded by these sRNAs. However, the majority of sRNAs with ribosome occupancy had no evidence of coding potential. Of these ribosome-associated sRNAs, 12 had differential ribosome occupancy or TE during oxidative stress, suggesting that they may play a regulatory role during the oxidative stress response. Our findings on ribosomal regulation during oxidative stress, coupled with potential roles for ribosome-associated noncoding sRNAs and sRNA-derived small proteins in H. volcanii, revealed additional regulatory layers and underscored the multifaceted architecture of stress-responsive regulatory networks.IMPORTANCEArchaea are found in diverse environments, including as members of the human microbiome, and are known to play essential ecological roles in major geochemical cycles. The study of archaeal biology has expanded our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotes, uncovered novel biological systems, and revealed new opportunities for applications in biotechnology and bioremediation. Many archaeal systems, however, remain poorly characterized. Using Haloferax volcanii as a model, we investigated the global translation landscape during oxidative stress. Our findings expand current knowledge of translational regulation in archaea and further illustrate the complexity of stress-responsive gene regulation.

To assess the cost-effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) relative to sodium fluoride (NaF) and traditional resin-modified glass ionomer cements (RMGIC) restorations for the management of root caries in older adults aged 60 and above. A Markov model design was chosen and two models were constructed: 1) Clinic-based model - with access to dental facility that allows for placement of traditional restorations, 2) Community-based model - without access to dental facility due to mobility, lack of executive function, or financial barriers. Modelling was done over a 10-year time horizon with a cycle length of one year. Data on transition probabilities and relative risks were obtained from published literature for the base case. Outcomes of interest were incremental cost per incremental caries-controlled year and incremental cost per incremental extraction-free year. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for uncertainty in the base case. In the clinic-based model, both SDF and NaF were dominated by traditional RMGIC restorations, which had lower cost, and higher number of caries-controlled and extraction-free years, with a 90% probability of being cost-effective. In the community-based model, NaF was dominated by SDF, which incurred lower cost and resulted in a higher number of caries-controlled and extraction-free years, with almost 100% probability of being cost-effective. Traditional RMGIC restoration was the most cost-effective option for managing root caries when full dental facility is available. In situations where treatment is provided in a community setting, SDF was more cost-effective than NaF. Based on limited clinical studies and within the Singapore oral health system, traditional RMGIC restoration was most cost-effective in clinical settings for managing root caries, while SDF was most cost-effective in community settings.

Background: Despite a plethora of evidence available on the benefits of palliative care (PC), it is estimated that only about 14% of those living in low- to middle-income countries (LMIC) or developing countries have access to PC. Objective: To globally examine PC expert perspectives regarding PC infrastructure and resources within each country, drug and opioid availability to provide PC, and workforce and educational issues. Design: Descriptive, open-ended survey seeking first-hand qualitative perspectives. Setting/Subjects: PC experts from 21 developing countries representing 5 continents around the world. Measurements: Qualitative narratives and discussions with PC experts. Results: The summaries inform four key recommendations for future progress of PC in developing countries: (1) PC infrastructure should increase accessibility to both urban and rural areas; (2) increasing medication and nonpharmacologic approaches for symptoms is essential; (3) interdisciplinary education should continue to expand and include scholarships, PC certifications, and advanced education; and 4) future research with developing countries is desperately needed to advance care and progress. Conclusions: Considerable PC progress has been accomplished; however, significant gaps remain. This report can be used to discuss PC capacity building within a country. It could serve as an important document while negotiating with authorities and Ministries of Health about expanding PC infrastructure, especially in rural areas. Finally, PC champions can use this report to advocate for increased opioid availability to promote comfort; in particular, increased availability of oral opioids is essential, so that patients can die comfortably at home.

Improving support for unpaid carers is a policy priority internationally, yet there are few reliable population estimates on numbers of end of life carers, and little is known about the demographic characteristics of this group. (1) Estimate the number of unpaid end of life carers in the UK; (2) Describe demographic characteristics of this group. An observational study using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey (Understanding Society), Health Survey for England and the Office for National Statistics to estimate the number of end of life carers in the UK. Understanding Society was used to explore characteristics of end of life carers including poverty before and after bereavement. Understanding Society collects annual data on around 40,000 households in the UK, including carers. Data from Understanding Society suggests there are 150,000-180,000 unpaid end of life care in the UK each year, while data from Health Survey for England suggests a higher estimate at 570,000-775,000 carers. End of life carers are more likely to be older and female. There is an increase in the percentage of carers falling into poverty one year after they provided care. These analyses have provided the first estimate of the number of end of life carers in the UK, using methods which are replicable in other countries. Our data provide a useful benchmark both for the UK and for other comparable high income countries. Many end of life carers are living in poverty, including after bereavement, showing a need for policy initiatives to provide support.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports patients with severe refractory cardiac or respiratory failure but managing residual circuit blood after weaning lacks consensus. After decannulation, the oxygenator and circuit retain approximately 500-700 mL of blood, depending on tubing length, cannula size, and circuit configuration. Clinicians usually choose among direct reinfusion, cell-salvage processing, or disposal. Direct reinfusion maintains circulating red cell mass and may help avert allogeneic transfusion, especially in borderline cases, but carries the risk of reintroducing free hemoglobin, inflammatory mediators, microthrombi, and air emboli. Cell salvage offers an intermediary strategy by removing harmful elements through washing and centrifugation, but introduces delays in volume return, mechanical red cell damage, loss of platelets and clotting factors, and added cost. Discarding the blood eliminates reinfusion risks but increases reliance on banked blood, which poses risks such as immunomodulation, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), and resource depletion. Modified CPD blood bags have shown promise for temporarily storing blood from ECMO or RRT circuits, particularly in neonatal and pediatric patients.Additionally, residual blood salvage during ECMO circuit changes, an often-overlooked opportunity for autologous transfusion, deserves greater emphasis. In the absence of standardized guidelines, current practice remains heterogeneous. We advocate prospective, multicenter trials comparing these strategies with endpoints including transfusion requirements, hemolysis and inflammation biomarkers, fluid balance, organ dysfunction scores, cost implications, and survival. Evidence-based protocols will enhance patient safety, reduce costs, and standardize ECMO care.
40908416	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Levetiracetam Dosing Optimization in Neurocritical Care Population: Neuro-ARC Study.	Levetiracetam, a first-line antiseizure medication, is primarily eliminated through the kidneys, with approximately 66% renal elimination. Consequently, its pharmacokinetics are significantly influenced by kidney function. Augmented renal clearance (ARC), a condition characterized by renal hyperfiltration, is frequently observed in critical care settings and can profoundly impact the disposition of renally eliminated drugs such as levetiracetam. Our objectives were to characterize levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in neurocritical care patients, identify covariates significantly influencing drug clearance, and provide clinicians with optimal dosage recommendations in those with and without ARC. This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study involving patients admitted to the participating centers with life-threatening neurological illnesses. Each participant had up to four plasma samples collected, and the samples were analyzed using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. The creatinine clearance (CLCR) of enrolled participants was measured using the 8-h urine collection method (measured  CLCR [mCLCR]). Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed using Monolix software. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to explore various dosage strategies and to suggest optimal levetiracetam regimens. Our study included 50 patients, with 35 patients (70%) experiencing ARC. Trough levetiracetam levels were significantly lower in the ARC group compared with the no-ARC group (median [interquartile range] 4.4 [11.5] vs. 11.8 [19] mg/L, p value = 0.039, respectively). Population pharmacokinetic modeling showed levetiracetam clearance at 4.6 ± 2.97 L/h and volume of distribution at 0.56 ± 0.63 L/kg, following a one-compartment model. The mCLCR significantly affected levetiracetam clearance. Simulations indicated that an initial 500 mg twice daily (BID) dosage is insufficient. Patients with mCLCR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, including patients with ARC, may need at least 1500 mg BID, whereas those with mCLCR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2 may require an initial dosage of 1250 mg BID. Augmented renal clearance significantly impacts the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam by enhancing clearance. Dosing simulations revealed the inadequacy of the initial 500 mg BID regimen, indicating a minimum dosage of 1500 mg BID is necessary for patients experiencing ARC to achieve reference range concentrations.

Noncommunicable diseases are the leading cause of death, present economic challenges to health care systems worldwide, and disproportionally affect vulnerable individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES). While digital health interventions (DHIs) offer scalable and cost-effective solutions to promote health literacy and encourage behavior change, key challenges concern how to effectively reach and engage vulnerable individuals. To this end, social media influencers provide a unique opportunity to reach millions, and lasting engagement can be ensured through the design of DHIs in a manner that specifically appeals to low-SES individuals through alignment with their social background. The objectives of this study were 2-fold: to assess the effectiveness of leveraging influencers to reach vulnerable individuals (as measured via app downloads per stream viewers) and evaluate how the design of a DHI can improve engagement among this group (as measured via completion of the intervention). This study used a cross-sectional, quasi-experimental field design to assess both (1) the effectiveness of influencers in reaching vulnerable individuals and (2) the impact of specific design elements-such as gamification and storytelling-on user engagement using a stress management DHI featuring a slow-paced breathing exercise. In total, 3 differently designed versions of this DHI were developed following a fractional factorial design (StressLess, Breeze, and TragicKingdom). Reach was calculated as the number of downloads per viewers per stream and influencer. Engagement with the DHI was measured via number of conversational turns and milestone and intervention completion rates. Participants' SES and technology acceptance were evaluated through a postintervention survey. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and ANOVAs were used to examine the effects of the DHI design on reach and engagement metrics. The recruitment via 8 influencers (total streams=25; total viewers=12,667) generated 220 downloads. The average reach ratio across streams amounted to 16.2% (SD 15.5%), with significant differences between conditions (ꭓ22=8.0, P=.02; StressLess: 8.1%, SD 9.3%; Breeze: 14%, SD 10.5%; TragicKingdom: 28.4%, SD 17.6%). The intervention completion rate across all DHI versions amounted to 7.7% (17/220), with no significant differences between conditions (P=.48). This work provides the first evidence that recruitment via influencers yields high reach ratios, moving far beyond the reach of traditional social media platforms. Nonetheless, based on the data collected, the ability to leverage such platforms to recruit vulnerable individuals remains unclear. In addition, while engagement with the promoted interventions was initially high, the completion rate of the full breathing exercise was comparably low, indicating that the influencer promotion strategy cannot fully overcome the well-documented adherence barriers in digital health.

American foulbrood (AFB) and European foulbrood (EFB), caused by Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius, respectively, are severe bacterial diseases that significantly affect honey bee health and productivity worldwide. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective disease management in apiaries. We developed and validated a multiplex point-of-care (POC) quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay that enables simultaneous and rapid detection of P. larvae and M. plutonius directly in apiaries. Our POC qPCR assay, using the XQ station (Postbio), had diagnostic sensitivity and specificity comparable to laboratory-based qPCR assays. For P. larvae detection, the POC qPCR assay had a sensitivity of 93% (56 of 60 samples) and specificity of 97% (97 of 100 samples). Similarly, for M. plutonius, sensitivity was 95% (59 of 62 samples) and specificity was 97% (97 of 100 samples). Our POC qPCR assay had analytical sensitivity comparable to that of laboratory-based qPCR assays, with a limit of detection of ~102 copies/reaction for both pathogens. Additionally, the assay had high analytical specificity, with no cross-reactivity against other common honey bee pathogens, including deformed wing virus (DWV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), and Vairimorpha ceranae. Our POC qPCR assay consistently had lower cycle quantification values than the laboratory-based qPCR on the same samples, indicating robust detection capability even at low pathogen concentrations. Although not compared to a gold standard, our POC qPCR assay had reliable diagnostic performance. Our multiplex POC qPCR assay enables rapid, accurate pathogen detection in apiaries, thereby enhancing disease management and supporting sustainable, productive apiculture.

Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal that exhibits strong carcinogenic properties and promotes breast cancer (BC) progression. Autophagic flux dysfunction is involved in Cd-induced BC progression, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, it is observed that impaired autophagic flux and metabolic reprogramming are notable features related to Cd-induced proliferation, migration, and invasion in BC cell lines, including T-47D and MCF-7 cells. Through the integration of metabolomics, proteomics, and ingenuity pathway analysis, a metabolite-protein regulatory network is constructed, which revealed that 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA)-mediated metabolic reprogramming plays a core regulatory role in the epigenetic‒autophagy axis involved in Cd-induced autophagic flux impairment and BC progression. Mechanistically, Cd-induced MTA depletion specifically increased DOT1L methyltransferase activity and H3K79me1 levels in the PAK2 promoter region, inducing the expression of PAK2, which contributed to the autophagic flux blockade required for BC progression in Cd-exposed BC cells and transgenic MMTV-ErbB2 mice. Clinically, a significant negative correlation is also verified between MTA levels and TNM stage in BC patients; that is, advanced-stage tumors exhibited notably lower MTA levels than early-stage tumors. Thus, the study provides insights into metabolism‒epigenetic crosstalk in the context of Cd-induced BC progression and highlights the importance of considering environmental factors in cancer healthcare.

Sodium homeostasis is crucial for physiological balance, yet the neurobiological mechanisms underlying sodium appetite remain incompletely understood. The nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) integrates visceral signals to regulate feeding behaviors, including sodium intake. This study investigated the role of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2)-expressing neurons in the NTS in mediating sodium appetite under low-sodium diet (LSD) conditions and elucidated the molecular pathways involved, particularly the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Using a murine model, sodium preference was assessed via a two-bottle choice test following LSD exposure. Previously published single-cell RNA sequencing data were re-analyzed to profile the transcriptional changes in HSD2 neurons. Pharmacological interventions employed MAPK inhibitor U0126 and cAMP inhibitor KH7 to dissect signaling contributions. Anterograde tracing and immunohistochemistry techniques were used to verify the efferent projections of HSD2 neurons. Autonomic function was evaluated by measuring blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and phrenic nerve discharge (PND) parameters in anesthetized mice during HSD2 neuron activation. LSD significantly activated HSD2 neurons and increased sodium intake. scRNA-seq analysis revealed upregulation of genes in the cAMP/MAPK pathways under LSD conditions. Pharmacological blockade of these pathways abolished LSD-induced sodium appetite. Anterograde tracing confirmed three primary downstream targets: the pre-locus coeruleus (pre-LC), lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBcL), and ventral lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (vlBNST). Notably, HSD2 neuron activation did not alter BP, HR, or PND parameters, indicating no direct role in autonomic regulation. LSD induces the activation of HSD2 neurons, which in turn causes sodium intake, a phenomenon that is eliminated by blocking the cAMP/MAPK signaling pathway. These neurons project to key forebrain and brainstem regions implicated in motivational behavior but do not directly modulate cardiovascular/respiratory functions. By replicating and extending prior research, this study supports and expands the present understanding of this field.

Following lung cancer, prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men. High-risk localized tumor burden or metastatic disease often progresses, refractory to initial treatment regimens. There is ongoing development of technology to appropriately identify high-risk patients, stage them correctly, and offer appropriate treatments to obtain the best clinical outcomes. Prostate cancer-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane glutamate carboxypeptidase, which helps regulate folate absorption, and its overexpression is pathologically directly proportional and associated with prostate cancer. Increased PSMA expression is a known independent risk factor for poorer survival, and most metastatic lesions in CRPC are PSMA positive. Over the last decade, several PSMA-based PET radiopharmaceuticals have demonstrated superior sensitivities and specificities compared to traditional imaging methods. These outcomes have been demonstrated by several large clinical trials. As the data emerges, these diagnostics are being integrated into standard of care protocol to facilitate nuanced identification of malignant lesions. PSMA is also being targeted through several therapeutics, including radioligands and immunotherapies such as CAR-T, BiTEs, and ADCs. This review will discuss the landscape of PSMA-based theranostics in the context of prostate cancer.

The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens is a typical pesticide-induced resurgent rice pest. A previous study showed that a fungicide, jinggangmycin (JGM)-treated rice led to markedly increased sugar content and (Insulin-like Peptide 2) ILP2 in response to sugar-mediated TOR signaling and stimulated fecundity in BPH. However, the role of the other ILPs in response to types of carbohydrate compounds remained poorly understood. The present studies showed that JGM treatment led to strongly increased glucose content and slightly increased sucrose and trehalose contents in rice plants. The 5th instar nymphs feeding with JGM-treated rice or exogenous glucose-supplied artificial diets markedly upregulated transcription of ILP2 and ILP3, triggered ILP/Foxo signaling transduction, and further induced ILP3 secretion in the female brain. Moreover, silencing of ILP3 in the nymphal stage through RNAi led to a significant decrease of ILP3 secretion in the brain compared with dsGFP-treated females and inhibited ILP/Foxo signaling transduction. Suppression of ILP3 decreased soluble protein content in the ovary and fat body, inhibited Vg expression and protein synthesis, and further blocked ovarian development in female adults. Finally, depletion of ILP3 significantly influenced reproductive parameters, including the number of laid eggs, oviposition period, number of offspring, hatching rate, and population growth indexes of BPH. The current study revealed the mechanism of diet glucose regulating BPH reproduction by inducing ILP3 expression, which complements the theory of pesticide-induced resurgence of rice pests and also provides an important gene target for green control of BPH.

DesignRandomized Controlled Trial.ObjectivePostoperative pain after lumbar spine surgery remains a clinical challenge. Fluoroscopy-guided erector spinae plane block (ESPB) has been proposed as a feasible technique for reducing pain and opioid use, particularly when ultrasound guidance is not available.MethodsIn this double-blind randomized controlled trial, 80 patients undergoing two to five levels of posterior lumbar fusion with single-level discectomy and interbody fusion were assigned to receive either fluoroscopy-guided ESPB with ropivacaine, dexamethasone, and saline or placebo. Pain intensity (Numerical Rating Scale), opioid consumption (Morphine Equivalent Dose), and other postoperative outcomes were assessed at 4, 24, 48, 72 h, and 6 months.ResultsThe ESPB group reported significantly lower axial pain scores at 4 and 24 h postoperatively (P = 0.017 and P = 0.0001, respectively). Opioid consumption was also significantly lower in the ESPB group during the first 48 h (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in radicular pain, patient satisfaction, time to ambulation, or hospital length of stay. At 6 months, both groups showed similar pain scores and rates of over-the-counter analgesic use. Infection rates were low and comparable between groups.ConclusionFluoroscopy-guided ESPB appears to be a safe and effective adjunct for reducing early postoperative pain and opioid requirements following posterior lumbar fusion. However, its benefits diminish beyond the immediate postoperative period, and it does not significantly impact long-term outcomes.

"This study aims to assess the effectiveness of training in nursing ethics and humanistic nursing care in enhancing the quality of nursing services and increasing patient satisfaction within the ""Internet + Health care"" framework in ophthalmology wards. A cohort of 20 nurses from the ophthalmology ward of the hospital participated in a 3-month training program from January to March 2024, focusing on nursing ethics and humanistic nursing care within the ""Internet + Health care"" framework. A total of 300 patients scheduled for cataract surgery in the same ward were selected for the study, with 150 patients allocated to control and intervention groups. The control group received standard nursing care under the ""Internet + Health care"" model, while the intervention group received care from nurses who had also undergone nursing ethics and humanistic care training. The humanistic care ability of nurses pretraining and post-training, as well as patients' self-efficacy, psychological resilience, and patient satisfaction, were compared between the 2 groups. Post-training, the nurses in the intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in knowing (83.86±7.26 versus 62.34±6.52, P<0.01), courage (78.31±7.82 versus 60.78±7.04, P<0.01), and patience (65.74±6.87 versus 51.49±5.43, P<0.01) dimensions, along with an overall increase in the caring ability inventory (CAI) total score (228.24±12.68 versus 185.43±10.44, P<0.01).

To investigate the physicochemical properties, in vitro efficacy, and in vivo therapeutic potential of novel tree turmeric root and nano-hydroxyapatite (TRE@NHA) composites in mitigating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). TRE@NHA composites were synthesized and characterized using FTIR, XRD, TGA, and HRTEM. In vitro studies using PC12 cells assessed cytotoxicity, anti-inflammatory effects, and neuroprotective properties. An in vivo rat model of CIPN was established using paclitaxel (PTX). Behavioral assessments, histopathological analysis, and oxidative stress markers were evaluated in sciatic nerve tissues. TRE@NHA composites demonstrated successful integration of TRE into the NHA matrix. In vitro studies revealed significant anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of TRE@NHA-2, particularly in suppressing cytokine production, enhancing cell viability, and mitigating oxidative stress. In vivo, TRE@NHA-2 effectively alleviated PTX-induced neuropathic pain, reduced neuronal damage, and exhibited potent antioxidant properties. This study demonstrates the successful development and characterization of novel TRE@NHA composites. The findings strongly suggest that TRE@NHA-2 possesses promising therapeutic potential for mitigating CIPN due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties.

Catheter ablation is a key treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). This procedure is clearly identifiable in French medical-administrative databases and can be used as a surrogate for symptomatic patients with drug-refractory or symptomatic paroxysmal AF forms. Breast cancer (BC) patients have an increased risk of AF, but knowledge about AF forms treated by ablation is limited. Based on a representative cohort of BC patients from the French National Health Databases, we aimed to assess the occurrence of AF catheter ablation in these patients, compared to the general population. Patients with a first diagnosis of BC between 2008 and 2018 and followed for at least 1 year until 2019 were eligible. The incidence rates of AF ablation among BC patients were compared to those in the general population by estimating a standardized incidence ratio (SIR). A competing risk survival model was used to evaluate the occurrence of AF ablation in BC patients treated with or without radiotherapy (RT) (subdistribution Hazard Ratio-sdHR). We included 3667 patients (78% with RT). Overall, 16 cases underwent AF ablation, whereas 8.3 cases were expected in the general population, resulting in a significant SIR of 1.93 [1.10-3.00] (p < 0.05). After a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, the cumulative incidence of AF ablation at 5 years was 0.14% [0.05-0.35] in the RT group and 0.47% [0.13-1.31] in the non-RT group, with no significant difference in the age-adjusted survival analysis (sdHR = 0.65 [0.21-2.01]). Our exploratory study revealed that BC patients had a twofold greater rate of first AF ablation than the age-comparable general population, without a link with RT. These results should be interpreted cautiously because of the limited size of the study population and the differing characteristics between the RT and non-RT groups.

"To describe the health care use of patients with symptomatic knee or hip OA and to identify factors associated with health care use trajectories over a 10-year period. This study used longitudinal data from the multicentre ""Knee-and-Hip-OsteoArthritis-Long-term-Assessment"" cohort, which comprised 878 patients with OA diagnoses confirmed by both a physician and radiographic evidence. We identified homogeneous subgroups of trajectories based on individual health care consumption over time via latent class growth analysis. Logistic regression analysis determined baseline factors associated with these trajectories. A minority of patients consulted a specialist. Impaired mental health was associated with moderate- and high-probability trajectories of consulting a primary care physician (PCP), a physical therapist and a rheumatologist (ORs 0.7 [0.6-0.9] to 0.9 [0.8-0.96]). High pain levels were associated only with high probability of consulting an orthopaedic surgeon (OS) (OR 0.8 [0.7-0.9]). Rheumatologist consultations were more likely in large cities (OR 2.3 [1.3-4.1]), and OS consultations were associated with a high level of education (OR 3.6 [1.3-7.4]). PCPs play a central role in OA care. High pain levels were associated mainly with a high probability of consulting an OS, whereas mental health status was a major predictive factor of other health care professional consultations. Mental health state is probably insufficiently accounted for. Social inequalities persist and must be considered in public health policies."

We aimed to analyze CD63, a cell surface protein that has been associated with tumor aggressiveness in several cancers, including breast, colorectal, and lung cancer, as well as melanoma, in prostate cancer. CD63 expression was analyzed immunohistochemically in a cohort of primary prostate cancers from 281 patients. The results were correlated with clinico-pathologic parameters, including biochemical recurrence. In addition, CD63 expression in 251 of the 281 patients with prostate cancer was compared with CD63 expression in matched benign tissue samples (490 tissue samples). The analysis was performed automatically using the open-source software QuPath© and tested for statistical significance. For comparison with the diagnostic markers AMACR and GOLPH2, CD63 was analyzed in an additional cohort of 198 Prostate cancers. CD63 expression was found in 100% of prostate cancer cases and benign tissue spots. Increased CD63 expression was significantly associated with higher tumor stage (pT), tumor grade (ISUP), as well as shorter progression-free survival (PFS). Compared with the CD63 intensity of benign tissue, expression in tumor tissue was higher in >80% of cases. In addition, combining the expression of CD63 and AMACR, positivity reached 97.2%, making CD63 a promising diagnostic biomarker in challenging cases. CD63 is commonly overexpressed in prostate cancer, and higher levels are associated with earlier biochemical tumor progression; hence, CD63 is a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in primary prostate cancer.

Adolescence is a developmental window in which mental health symptomatology and other health behaviors can set lifelong trajectories. Yet, adolescent development research in rural areas of low-resource communities is severely lacking. Conceptualized in the Adolescent Well-Being Framework, where diet and activity form a core domain of well-being, we examined two modifiable risk behaviors (sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and physical activity) and their associations with mental health and substance use problems among 1351 adolescents aged 10-17 years (51% girls) in a rural setting in Lesotho, southern Africa. Standardized screening measures showed at least one clinically relevant mental health problem among 3% of the overall sample and 5% among 15-17 year-olds. Among those in the overall sample meeting these criteria, 45% recognized a need for help, yet only 17% obtained any care, leaving an 83% treatment gap. After adjusting for age and sex, any sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was associated with having at least one mental health symptom or recent substance use and with clinically relevant mental health and substance use problems. Physical activity showed no significant associations. Although the overall prevalence of clinically relevant mental health and substance use problems was relatively low, low levels of problem awareness suggest a need for adolescent-appropriate demand-side interventions for early treatment. Future research may explore possible indigenous protective factors underlying the low prevalence and clarify the pathway between health behaviors and mental health problems.

Cervical derangement syndrome (CDS), a form of mechanical neck pain, arises from poor posture, repetitive stress, and segmental dysfunction, resulting in discomfort, restricted cervical mobility, and reduced functional capacity. The study focuses on changes associated with CDS, particularly range of motion (ROM), pain, and functional disability. The study aims to find the effect of kinetic control training (KCT) and the McKenzie approach on CDS. The McKenzie approach emphasizes symptom centralization through repeated directional movements, while KCT focuses on restoring movement efficiency via motor control retraining. This study compares their effectiveness in managing CDS. The study aimed to determine the effect of KCT and the McKenzie approach on pain, functional disability, and ROM in individuals suffering from CDS. A comparative study was conducted involving 112 participants diagnosed with CDS. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups using the envelope method. Group A (McKenzie) and Group B (KCT), with 56 participants in each group initially. Following the exclusion of six participants, the final sample consisted of 53 participants in Group A and 53 in Group B. Both groups received baseline conventional therapy followed by six weeks of their respective interventions. Pre- and post-intervention outcome measures included the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), and cervical ROM. Statistical analysis was conducted using paired and unpaired t-tests via IBM SPSS Statistics, version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The findings demonstrated statistically significant enhancements in pain intensity, functional capacity, and cervical ROM in both groups. But Group B (KCT) demonstrated superior outcomes (p < 0.0001). In Group B (activity), VAS, NDI, and ROM improved significantly in all directions compared to Group A (McKenzie). The study concluded that a six-week intervention of KCT is more effective than the McKenzie approach in reducing pain and enhancing functional capacity and cervical mobility in individuals with CDS.

Anastomosing hemangioma typically presents as an asymptomatic lesion in the genitourinary tract, but can cause abdominal pain and hematuria. Early identification and surgical removal are crucial to avoid poor outcomes. We report a case of acute paralysis due to rapid tumor enlargement during pregnancy. This case is unique as anastomosing hemangiomas rarely occur in the spinal region, and cases where they cause such severe symptoms have rarely been reported, particularly in pregnant women. This case highlights the critical need for early recognition and intervention in anastomosing hemangiomas, particularly when rapid growth can lead to severe complications such as paralysis. The rare presentation during pregnancy highlights the importance of considering anastomosing hemangioma in the differential diagnosis. Further, this case highlights that timely surgical intervention is essential to prevent catastrophic outcomes and to improve patient prognosis.

When randomized trials are unavailable or not feasible, observational studies can be used to answer causal questions about the comparative effects of interventions by attempting to emulate a hypothetical pragmatic randomized trial (target trial). Published guidance to aid reporting of these studies is not available. To develop consensus based guidance for reporting observational studies performed to estimate causal effects by explicitly emulating a target trial. The Transparent Reporting of Observational Studies Emulating a Target Trial (TARGET) guideline was developed using the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) framework. The development included (1) a systematic review of reporting practices in published studies that had explicitly aimed to emulate a target trial; (2) a two round online survey (August 2023 to March 2024; 18 expert participants from six countries) to assess the importance of candidate items selected from previous research and to identify additional items; (3) a three day, expert consensus meeting (June 2024; 18 panelists) to refine the scope of the guideline and draft the checklist; and (4) pilot of the draft checklist with stakeholders (n=108; September 2024 to February 2025). The checklist was further refined based on feedback on successive drafts. The 21-item TARGET checklist is organized into six sections (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, other information). TARGET provides guidance for reporting observational studies of interventions explicitly emulating a parallel group, individually randomized target trial, with adjustment for baseline confounders. Key recommendations are to (1) identify the study as an observational emulation of a target trial; (2) summarize the causal question and reason for emulating a target trial; (3) clearly specify the target trial protocol (ie, the causal estimand, identifying assumptions, data analysis plan) and how it was mapped to the observational data; and (4) report the estimate obtained for each causal estimand, its precision, and findings from additional analyses to assess the sensitivity of the estimates to assumptions, and design and analysis choices. Application of the TARGET guideline recommendations aims to improve reporting transparency and peer review and help researchers, clinicians, and other readers interpret and apply the results.

In neuroblastoma (NB), urinary catecholamine excretion and 123ImIBG avidity-depending on tumor enzymatic activity and norepinephrine transporter expression, respectively-are diagnostic standards. The prognostic impact of atypical NB, without urinary catecholamine excretion and/or 123ImIBG avidity, remains to be determined. We sought to determine the frequency and prognosis of atypical NB and investigate the significance of catecholamine profiles and 123ImIBG avidity at diagnosis. From 2000 to 2020, 275 children with NB, aged 0-20 years at diagnosis, treated at Institut Curie, France, were retrospectively analyzed. Overall, 24% of NB had atypical features (n = 67/275). Lower INRG stages L1/L2 were more frequent in atypical NB, 66% versus 28% (n = 44/67 vs. 59/208), with less INRG Stage M than in typical NB, 25% versus 61% (n = 17/67 vs. 126/208), p < 0.001. Atypical tumors more frequently harbored favorable molecular features with less frequent MYCN amplification, 12% (n = 8/64) versus 29% (n = 58/201), p < 0.01, and fewer cases with segmental chromosomal alterations, 30% (n = 13/44) versus 60% (n = 69/115), p < 0.05. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were better in atypical than typical NB (5-year EFS: 77% ± 5% vs. 50% ± 4% and OS 87% ± 4% vs. 65% ± 4%, p < 0.001). However, in multivariate analysis, atypical features in NB were not significant independent markers of prognosis. Atypical NB constitute a subgroup of interest for biomolecular analyses, including transcriptomics, which might provide further insights into disease-associated molecular features and our understanding of NB development.

Bile acid malabsorption (BAM) or bile acid diarrhea (BAD) complicates more than 30% of Crohn's disease (CD), yet no non-invasive biomarker reliably identifies patients who will benefit from fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). We investigated whether serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a hepatic bile-acid synthesis precursor, can predict BAM and FMT response in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We included 106 pairs of IBD patients treated with FMT from two longitudinal cohorts of prospective trials and 24 matched healthy individuals to identify a multi-omics analysis of microbiota-metabolism and evaluate real-world effectiveness of FMT. Fecal and serum samples before and after FMT along with medical information were collected and detected through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Mice models were used to preliminarily verify the exacerbation of colitis through administration of primary BAs and treated by FMT. Patients in BAM group tended to achieve sustained higher and stable clinical response (66.67% vs. 49.41%) and remission (52.38% vs. 40.00%) than non-BAM group at 3 months after FMT, along with a significantly decrease of C4 (P < 0.001), improvement of obvious abdominal pain and diarrhea, which was especially obvious in CD patients with ileal resection and ileal /ileocolonic type. Random forest classifiers predicted BAM in IBD patients with 18 or top 4 differential OTUs, showing an area under the curve of 0.92 and 0.83, respectively. Furthermore, results from primary bile acid-induced colitis mice models reinforced these findings. Serum C4 and a minimal gut microbiota may identify IBD patients with BAM who are most likely to achieve durable remission after FMT. These translatable biomarkers can guide precision use of microbiota-directed therapy. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01790061 and NCT01793831.

Group I represented the normal-control group. Group II represented the Bleo-control group. Groups III and IV received intra-tracheal Bleo followed by oral ECH (25 and 50 mg/kg); respectively, for 1 month. Lung tissue contents of reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 & MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio, collagen-1 and alpha-Smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were measured. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) genes were quantified using PCR. Moreover, lung tissue histopathological changes were screened. Intra-tracheal Bleo instillation resulted in significant increments in the lung tissue contents of MDA, TGF-β, MMP-2 & MMP-9, TIMP-1, MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio, collagen-1 and α-SMA. Moreover, Bleo significantly elevated the PCR expression of NOX4, CTGF and ET-1 genes in lung tissues and caused apparent lung tissue histopathological fibrotic changes. ECH treatment ameliorated all the aforementioned parameters and mitigated the lung tissue histopathological fibrotic changes induced by Bleo. The study highlighted for the first time the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of ECH against Bleo-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. The study suggests that these effects are mainly mediated via the modulation of Gelatinases, NOX4, ET-1 and CTGF. Accordingly, ECH is anticipated as a potential therapy to be added to the treatment regimen of pulmonary fibrosis.
40919817	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Prophage-encoded virulence factor, Gp05, contributes to endothelial cell dysfunction and immune evasion to promote persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endovascular infections.	Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause of endovascular infections, where interactions with endothelial cells play a critical role in pathogenesis. Gp05, a prophage-encoded protein, has previously been implicated in promoting antibiotic persistence by modulating MRSA cellular physiology and evading neutrophil-mediated killing. In this study, we investigated the role of Gp05 in MRSA-endothelial cell interactions, focusing on its impact on bacterial adhesion, invasion, cytotoxicity, and the host inflammatory response. Using an isogenic MRSA strain set-including a clinical persistent bacteremia isolate (PB 300-169), a gp05 deletion mutant, and a gp05-complemented strain-we found that deletion of gp05 significantly impaired MRSA invasion, intracellular survival, and damage toward endothelial cells. Notably, endothelial cells infected with the gp05 deletion mutant induced a heightened endothelial inflammatory response, characterized by increased production of cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and CCL2/MCAF) and upregulated expression of inflammatory- and adhesion-associated molecules (VEGF, VCAM-1, TLR2, and TLR6). Furthermore, treatment of endothelial cells with purified Gp05 protein alone was sufficient to suppress endothelial inflammatory signaling and induce cytotoxic effects, suggesting that Gp05 exerts both intracellular and extracellular functions: intracellularly, by attenuating host immune activation to promote bacterial survival, and extracellularly, by directly disrupting endothelial barrier integrity and dampening immune recognition. In conclusion, Gp05 is a key virulence factor that contributes to MRSA persistence in endovascular infections by promoting endothelial cell dysfunction, suppressing host immune response, and enhancing bacterial survival. These findings highlight Gp05 as a potential therapeutic agent for disrupting MRSA pathogenesis in vascular tissues. This study reveals the critical role of Gp05, a prophage-encoded protein, in promoting antibiotic persistence during MRSA endovascular infections by modulating endothelial cell responses. By demonstrating that Gp05 enhances S. aureus endothelial cell invasion, intracellular survival, and cytotoxicity, while simultaneously suppressing host immune signaling, the research highlights Gp05 as a dual-function factor with both intracellular and extracellular effects on MRSA-host endothelial cell interactions. The identification of Gp05's capacity to disrupt endothelial cells and dampen host immune system advances our understanding of the mechanism of MRSA persistence. Given the clinical challenges of treating persistent MRSA infections, especially in endovascular contexts, these findings position Gp05 as a compelling target for novel therapeutic strategies.

Cocaine use disorder (CUD) affects 1.4 million people in the United States, yet no FDA-approved treatments exist. In 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a draft guideline on treatments for stimulant use disorders, providing direction for trial design, outcomes, and population selection. In this study, we aimed to review ongoing clinical trials for CUD and assess their alignment with the FDA's recommendations. We conducted a systematic search of the 6 major clinical trial databases (United States, Australia, Canada, Iran, Netherlands, and Switzerland) to identify ongoing interventional studies for CUD. We included trials evaluating pharmacological, behavioral, device-based, and mixed treatments. We extracted data on intervention type, target population, study design, duration, and primary outcomes. Trials were assessed for alignment with 5 key FDA recommendations, including trial duration, use of both self-reported and biological outcome measures, randomization, placebo control, and double blinding. In total, 38 trials were identified, primarily from the United States (32). Most trials were randomized: 36 (94.7%), while 21 (55.3%) trials had combined endpoints or a 3-month minimum duration. Only 7 trials (18.4%) met all 5 key FDA recommendations. New treatment approaches were identified, including psilocybin and the dAd5GNE vaccine, as well as digital platforms for behavioral therapies. A variety of promising treatments for CUD are under investigation. However, many trials fall short of current FDA design recommendations. Improved adherence to regulatory guidance and stronger collaboration between researchers and regulators will be essential to advance effective, scalable treatments for CUD.

Narratives from adolescent girls and community males following pregnancy escalation during COVID-19 lockdown.	Adolescent sexual and reproductive health in low- and middle-income countries is critical to address following the COVID-19 pandemic. Growing evidence of its' impact includes increased teenage pregnancies and higher rates of unsafe abortion. Our qualitative study sought to understand perspectives and behaviours around these escalations. Using random sampling we conducted focus group discussions with adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) from western Kenya to understand perceptions and behaviours that drove high rates of pregnancy and abortion. Alongside, male opinions were sought using opportunistic sampling to recruit participants. Six FGDs with AGYW (n = 54) and five with community males (n = 53) were conducted with data analysed using thematic analysis. Results were grouped under 4 themes: (1) Fear, responsibility and blame; (2) Drivers of abortion; (3) Accessing an abortion; (4) Family planning including condom use. AGYW narratives revealed a dread of unintended pregnancy fearing parental and community reactions whilst men feared unfair blame from the community for impregnating AGYW despite admissions of sexual relationships with schoolgirls. Abortion attempts were common, girls described clandestine bids, including ingestion of dangerous or ineffective products, methods corroborated by the men. Many participants, male and female did nothing to mitigate pregnancy risks, disliking condoms and perceiving family planning as a threat to future fertility, or giving license to girls' promiscuity. AGYW remain at high pregnancy and unsafe abortion risk until community attitudes and knowledge are challenged. Our findings highlight the need for information and education to dispel myths and misinformation regarding family planning methods, and address inequities in gender norms. Safe, legal and affordable abortion is also paramount. Follow-up is required to assess long term physical and psychological consequences of the high number of unwanted pregnancies and abortions, particularly amongst those who had a failed abortion.

Phenotypic plasticity is a recognized mechanism of therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer (PCa), however current knowledge of driver mechanisms and therapeutic interventions are limited. Using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) devoid of Pten and Rb1, we previously demonstrated the chromatin reprogramming factor enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) as an important regulator of alternative transcription programs promoting phenotypic plasticity. Here, using a multi-omics approach we demonstrate that EZH2 regulates multilineage cell states dependent on the RNA binding protein Tristetraprolin (TTP) that mediates RNA stability and activation of translation. Combined chemical inhibition of EZH2 and PI3K/mTORC1 resulted in superior anti-tumor activity in murine and human phenotypic plastic models and was most significant when this combination was used with castration or enzalutamide. Together, these data indicate phenotypic plasticity dependence on coordination between EZH2, TTP and mTORC1 signaling that represent novel therapeutic dependencies for this lethal PCa phenotype.

Uncertainties persist regarding the utilization of hearts from SARS-CoV-2-positive donors for heart transplant (HT). This international study analyzed such HTs within the United States (US) and Germany, focusing on 1-year outcomes and granular safety data. Data was obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry (03/2021-08/2022) and collaborating with the German Organ Procurement Organisation (DSO; 03/2022-02/2023). HTs from currently and recently (up to 21 days in UNOS and 90 days in DSO) SARS-CoV-2-positive donors were included. In the US, 274 HTs from SARS-CoV-2 donors were analyzed (50.7% SARS-CoV-2-positive until organ recovery). Compared to 3952 HTs from SARS-CoV-2-negative donors, acute rejection was less frequent (10.6% vs. 17.1%, p = 0.006). One-year graft and recipient survival (p = 0.327) and rehospitalization rates (p = 0.592) did not differ. In Germany, 30 HTs utilized SARS-CoV-2-positive hearts. Follow-up was obtained for 23 (76.7%). 43.5% of the donors were positive until recovery. Two recipients (8.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 21 and 65 days post-transplant, both unlikely donor-derived. 8.7% had severe PGD, 8.7% acute cellular rejection ≥ 2R. One-year survival was 91.3%. None experienced myocarditis or thromboembolism. Using selected SARS-CoV-2-positive hearts for transplant appears safe with no differences in 1-year survival, no evidence of viral transmission or SARS-CoV-2-related adverse cardiovascular events.

Echinococcosis is a chronic parasitic disease with an uneven distribution that poses a significant threat to human health and impedes economic development. As China is one of the major endemic countries, it is crucial to elucidate the spatiotemporal distribution and primary influencing factors of this disease for effective prevention and control, particularly for long-term research. This study utilizes data on human echinococcosis in mainland China from 2004 to 2020, integrating socio-economic, biological, meteorological, and other indicators. Employing methods such as epidemiological analysis, inverse distance weighting (IDW), cluster analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis, we analyzed high-incidence areas and significant related factors to identify high-risk regions and elucidate local epidemiological characteristics. The findings indicate that human echinococcosis in China is predominantly concentrated in the northwest region but exhibits a trend of spreading southeastward. The disease primarily affects young and middle-aged individuals aged 25 to 45, with reported cases among infants and adolescents accounting for as high as 9.4%. Although the disease lacks obvious seasonality, it is significantly correlated with factors such as the number of sheep, illiteracy rate, temperature, precipitation, humidity, and the level of urbanization. To effectively reduce the spread of this disease, it is imperative to strengthen interdepartmental cooperation, enhance public health awareness, and continuously implement targeted prevention and control measures.

Smoking induces inflammation in the heart and intima layer of blood vessels by activating nuclear factor kappa B, which controls the transcription of immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC)-κ. FLC levels are indicative of higher mortality in the overall population and poorer prognoses in cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to analyze the effect of smoking cessation (SC) on the levels of FLCs and markers of inflammation and heart failure. This study enrolled first visit smokers determined to quit smoking at our hospital. Levels of various clinical parameters, including inflammatory markers, such as FLC, were measured on their first clinic visit and after 3 months of successful SC. Body-mass-index (BMI) values significantly increased from baseline to 3 months after SC (n = 76, p = 0.004). Conversely, the levels of inflammatory markers including FLC-κ, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte-ratio and NT-proBNP significantly decreased after SC (p = 0.042, p = 0.024 and p = 0.030, respectively). Proportional changes in FLC-κ levels observed after SC showed a significant correlation with those of C-reactive-protein (r = 0.349, p = 0.002) and NT-proBNP (r = 0.332, p = 0.005) levels in the successful SC group. Levels of FLC-κ, a novel inflammatory and cardiovascular risk biomarker, decreased significantly after SC in association with NT-proBNP, suggesting the SC-induced reduction of cardiac load as well as a decrease in inflammation.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent and heterogeneous sleep disorder associated with significant health and societal burdens. While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the gold standard treatment, its limitations in adherence and patient tolerance have highlighted the need for alternative therapies. Positional therapy (PT), which targets apneas that occur predominantly in the supine position, has emerged as a promising option for individuals with positional OSA (POSA). This narrative review synthesizes the current literature on PT, examining its clinical indications, typologies, comparative efficacy with CPAP, oral appliances, and hypoglossal nerve stimulation, as well as data on adherence and barriers to long-term use. Traditional methods such as the tennis ball technique have largely been replaced by modern vibrotactile devices, which demonstrate improved comfort, adherence, and comparable short-term outcomes in selected POSA subjects. While PT remains inferior to CPAP in reducing overall AHI and oxygen desaturation, it performs favorably in terms of mean disease alleviation (MDA) and sleep continuity. Importantly, treatment effectiveness is influenced by both anatomical and non-anatomical traits, underscoring the need for accurate phenotyping and individualized care. PT should be considered within a broader patient-centered model that incorporates preferences, lifestyle, and motivational factors. Further research is needed to validate long-term efficacy, optimize selection criteria, and integrate PT into personalized OSA management strategies.

Contact dermatitis (CD), which includes both allergic CD and irritant CD, is a common inflammatory condition that can pose significant diagnostic challenges. Although patch testing is the gold standard for identifying causative allergens for allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), it is time-consuming, subjective, and requires expert interpretation. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in machine learning (ML) and deep learning, have shown promise in improving the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of CD diagnosis and management. This review explores current applications of AI in CD, drawing from 12 original studies that investigated AI-based image analysis, biomarker discovery, and patient risk profiling. Convolutional neural networks demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy (up to 99.5%) in interpreting patch test images, while ML algorithms successfully identified transcriptomic signatures distinguishing allergic CD from irritant CD. In addition, AI has been used to predict positive patch test outcomes and identify high-risk patients based on clinical and occupational factors. Despite these promising developments, limitations such as dataset bias, lack of standardization, and model interpretability remain. Nevertheless, AI represents a transformative tool in dermatology, offering the potential for standardized diagnostics, personalized care, and enhanced accessibility.

Effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment for Parkinson's disease requires careful adjustment of stimulation parameters and targeting to avoid motor side effects caused by activation of the internal capsule. Currently, patients must self-report side effects during device programming and implantation surgery - a challenging and subjective process that could lead to suboptimal therapy or exacerbate the time needed to optimize treatment. Motor evoked potentials (mEP), the use of electromyography to record DBS-induced muscle activation, offer a promising biomarker for objective motor side effect detection. Here, we present an automated algorithmic procedure for mEP detection and quantification. First, we design and evaluate a series of signal processing techniques to accurately detect mEP while mitigating the influence of stimulation artifacts and noise, then demonstrate a strategy for integrating multi-channel EMG responses into a single side effect biomarker (the mEP score). Next, we use data from a large patient cohort of intraoperative recordings (N = 54 STN leads) to quantify several physiological features of mEP, including their response frequency, latency, amplitude, and waveform similarity properties. Last, we show that the mEP score responds to DBS amplitude and contact configuration parameters in a manner that is consistent with expected STN-capsular anatomy. The results of this study inform an end-to-end approach for side effect biomarker measurement that could aid the precision and efficiency of DBS programming and surgical targeting.

Pharmacokinetic differences between long-acting injectable antipsychotic (LAI) formulations, combined with a lack of clinical switch studies, contribute to clinician uncertainty when transitioning between LAIs. This analysis employed a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) modeling approach to characterize dosing conversions and switching strategies from intramuscular paliperidone palmitate once monthly (PP1m) to TV-46000, a long-acting subcutaneous formulation of risperidone, once monthly (q1m), with a secondary analysis of PP1m to TV-46000 every 2 months (q2m). For PP1m and TV-46000, concentration-time profiles for paliperidone and TV-46000 total active moiety (TAM; risperidone + paliperidone) were simulated on the basis of published popPK models with virtual populations of 5000 patients. TAM exposure following oral administration served as a comparison benchmark. When switching from PP1m 234 mg at steady state (comparable to 6 mg/day oral risperidone), the most comparable switch involved initiating TV-46000 125 mg q1m 4 weeks after the last PP1m dose. Ratios of TV-46000 to PP1m for maximum, minimum, and average plasma concentration (Cmax, Cmin, and Cavg, respectively) post switch ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 after the first dose and 1.0-1.3 at steady state. Switching from other PP1m doses to TV-46000 q1m (comparable to 2-4 mg daily oral risperidone) using a 4-week interval demonstrated comparable TAM exposures. When switching from PP1m 234 mg to TV-46000 250 mg q2m, Cmax was higher and Cmin lower than that of q1m, though Cavg remained comparable to 5/6 mg daily oral risperidone. Switching to TV-46000 125 mg q1m 4 weeks after the last PP1m 234-mg injection yielded generally comparable pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state. The same was true for other TV-46000 q1m or q2m dosages and equivalent dosages of PP1m. Clinician discretion will ultimately determine how to switch on the basis of factors such as patient preference, convenience, and concerns about tolerability or symptom breakthrough.

Retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma represents a poor-prognosis malignancy for which current clinical treatment options remain limited. This study may further help bridge the gap in available therapeutic modalities. This case report describes a 75-year-old female patient who was admitted to the hospital with right lower abdominal pain and imaging studies suggesting a retroperitoneal mass and consideration of leiomyosarcoma. After the diagnosis was confirmed by imaging analysis combined with puncture biopsy, the patient received chemotherapy with adriamycin (75 mg/m²) and dacarbazine (200 mg/m²) to shrink the tumor once every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, which resulted in tumor shrinkage, and then underwent resection of the retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma combined with resection of the inferior vena cava lesions. The retroperitoneal tumor involving the inferior vena cava (IVC) was completely resected without requiring IVC reconstruction during the surgical procedure. Final histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. The patient demonstrated an uneventful postoperative recovery with no surgical complications, and subsequent follow-up evaluations revealed no evidence of disease recurrence, resulting in substantial improvement in the patient's quality of life on the basis of standardized oncology performance metrics. This case emphasizes the critical role of imaging in diagnosis and surgical strategies. This study provides new ideas for the complete resection of retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma. More studies are needed in the future to optimize the treatment strategy for this type of tumor.

Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Acupuncture has demonstrated benefits in cLBP management. Combining it with stretching or Qigong may enhance therapeutic outcomes. This pilot study assessed the feasibility and preliminary effects of acupuncture alone and in combination with stretching or Qigong. Thirty participants with cLBP were randomly assigned to receive (A) acupuncture only, (B) acupuncture plus static stretching, or (C) acupuncture plus modified Qigong, over eight weeks. The primary outcome was the pressure pain threshold (PPT). Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, disability, physical function, psychosocial measures, and quality of life. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and two-month follow-up. Data were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. However, the study was not powered to detect between-group changes, as the aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of the design, and the results need to be interpreted with caution. All groups showed statistically significant improvements over time in PPT, pain intensity, disability, functional performance, psychosocial status, and physical quality of life (p < 0.001). No significant group-by-time interactions were observed. However, descriptive trends suggested greater improvements in the PPT and function in the combination therapy groups. Several outcomes exceeded minimal clinically important differences, and large effect sizes were observed for pain (d = -3.32), disability (d = -1.85), and psychosocial distress (d = -1.17). No adverse events occurred, and adherence was high. Acupuncture, alone and in combination with stretching or Qigong, resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in pain sensitivity, disability, and psychosocial outcomes. The protocol was feasible and well-tolerated. There are emerging indications from this study that combining acupuncture with other modalities may enhance therapeutic effects, highlighting the need for a larger sample to confirm these findings.

Many studies have explored silicon's (Si) impact on cadmium (Cd) accumulation in rice, but a comprehensive assessment of Si's remediation efficacy and its molecular mechanisms is lacking. This review synthesizes 25 years of research on Si's role in mitigating Cd stress, focusing on how Si application affects Cd absorption, transport, and accumulation to provide theoretical support and technical guidance for using Si in the remediation of Cd-contaminated soils and safe rice production. Both soil and foliar applications of Si fertilizers reduce Cd accumulation in rice grains, with Si showing significant effects in controlling Cd within the plant by improving rice's physiological condition under Cd stress, adjusting hormone levels, enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, and promoting Cd chelation to the cell wall, reducing cellular damage. Si also regulates the expression of Cd transport proteins, with ten identified, five of which are particularly crucial: OsHMA2, OsNramp1, OsNramp5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7. Six other proteins' relationship with Si remains unconfirmed and requires further investigation. Research on how Si coordinates interactions among various factors such as Cd transport proteins, antioxidant defence systems, and plant hormones to comprehensively enhance rice's resistance to Cd stress is still limited. It was revealed that foliar application of Si is more effective in reducing Cd levels in rice, while in heavily Cd-contaminated soils, soil application of Si is more effective. Future in-depth understanding of Si's role in this network will not only help reveal its multifaceted protective mechanisms but also provide new perspectives for developing more effective strategies to mitigate heavy metal pollution.

The 2022/2023 season witnessed a rapid resurgence of H1N1pdm09 in Anhui Province, China, surpassing previous years, prompting an examination of hemagglutinin (HA) gene mutations and cross-immunity in this study. Anhui Province's surveillance data established the detection threshold for H1N1pdm09 using the Moving Epidemic Method. Joinpoint regression compared weekly percent change (WPC) rates. A total of 103 strains of H1N1pdm09 were sequenced and analyzed, and cross-reactivity was assessed using Pepitope model. The ILI% (percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness) and influenza detection rate for the 2022/2023 season were 6.82% and 31.90%, respectively, which surpassed those of 2017/2018-2021/2022. The H1N1pdm09 subtype dominated this outbreak. The epidemic threshold for H1N1pdm09 was 3.53%, exceeded in the sixth week of 2022/2023, leading to a shorter but intense epidemic phase. The WPC for the 2022/2023 season reached 376.40% (95% confidence interval: 253.4%-545.8%), faster than in the prior seasons. Sequence analysis showed that a majority of the 32 strains, obtained in the 2022/2023 season, belonged to clade 6B.1A.5a.2a, with only one strain identified as 6B.1A.5a.2a.1. Cross-protection efficacy against representative strains from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 seasons was limited (25.54%, 34.69%). This analysis provides insights into Anhui's influenza situation, including early warning thresholds, molecular and immune perspectives, and cost-effective prevention and control strategies.IMPORTANCEThe H1N1pdm09-associated morbidity and mortality impact negatively on the socio-economic status of the affected population. Potential modification of the genetic and antigenic traits of the virus, as it circulates, has raised concern that it may hinder a host's immune response or vaccine efficacy. These have prompted researchers to come up with intervention measures to manage H1N1pdm09 as a pathway to ease the pressure on public health.

Recurrent cystitis is a prevalent condition, especially among postmenopausal women, significantly impairing their quality of life. Antibiotic therapy has historically been the primary treatment; however, concerns over antimicrobial resistance have highlighted the need for alternative therapies. Vaginal laser therapy, a noninvasive approach, has shown promise in improving vaginal health and may help prevent recurrent cystitis. This study assessed the efficacy of vaginal laser therapy in reducing cystitis episodes and improving the vaginal environment among postmenopausal women with recurrent cystitis. This retrospective study involved 51 postmenopausal women who received vaginal laser therapy between January 2023 and July 2024. Eligible patients underwent a pretreatment phase with estriol ovules, followed by vaginal laser therapy. The Vaginal Health Index (VHI), vaginal pH, and cystoscopic findings were evaluated before and after treatment and are presented as median (interquartile range). The cystitis-free interval (CFI) was calculated to assess the duration between treatment and recurrence. The median number of cystitis episodes significantly decreased from 4 (3-6) in the 6 months before treatment to 0 (0-1) in the 6 months after treatment (p < 0.001 unless stated otherwise). The median CFI was 9.2 months. The VHI score significantly improved from 10 (9-13) to 18 (15-21), and vaginal pH significantly decreased from 8.0 to 5.5. Cystoscopic assessments indicated significant improvements in the atrophy of vaginal and periurethral tissues. Only grade 1 adverse events (7.8%) were observed, including vaginal pain and dyspareunia. Vaginal laser therapy significantly reduced cystitis episodes and improved vaginal tissue health in postmenopausal women with recurrent cystitis. These findings suggest that this therapy may represent a promising alternative in selected patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes and prospective designs are required to confirm these results and investigate the long-term benefits of vaginal laser therapy in managing recurrent cystitis.

BACKGROUND Pregnancy-related anatomical and physiological changes, such as mucosal edema and increased oxygen demand, heighten risk of difficult airway, especially under general anesthesia. This study compared effects of spinal and general anesthesia on postoperative airway assessment tests in cesarean deliveries. We hypothesized upper airway changes can occur depending on anesthesia technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS This prospective observational study included 100 pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean delivery. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to anesthesia type: spinal (n=64) and general (n=36). Five basic airway assessment tests (modified Mallampati score, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, neck circumference, and upper lip bite test) were performed preoperatively and 1, 6, and 24 h after surgery (T1-T4). RESULTS No significant changes were observed over time in the spinal group (all P>0.05), with Mallampati scores remaining stable from T1 to T4 (mean T1: 1.7±0.6; T4: 1.8±0.5). In contrast, general anesthesia group showed a significant increase in Mallampati scores at T2 (T1: 1.7±0.6 vs T2: 2.4±0.7, P<0.001). Postoperative nausea and vomiting were more frequent in the general anesthesia group (27.8% vs 10.9%, P=0.016). In hemodynamic evaluation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were significantly higher at the 2nd and 5th minutes in the general anesthesia group (2nd min SBP: 128.4±20.6 mmHg vs 114.5±17.4 mmHg; 5th min SBP: 121.4±15.6 mmHg vs 107.1±14.7 mmHg; both P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The significant increase in Mallampati scores after general anesthesia highlights the potential for upper airway edema due to intubation. Anticipating this risk is important for airway safety in the early postpartum period.

We identified octogenarians who underwent cardiac valve reoperations between 2004 and 2023. Study endpoints were long-term mortality, long-term self-reported physical activity, and general health status. 934 octogenarians (median age 83 years, 29% women) had valve reoperations. Reoperations were isolated procedures in 72% (aortic[58%], mitral[10%], and tricuspid[4%]), multiple valve procedures in 16%, and valve+CABG in 12%. Previous operations were isolated CABG in 53%, isolated valve in 27%, valve+CABG in 17%, and others in 3%. Operative mortality was 6%. Total hospital stay was 6 days (4-9). Median survival was 5.6 years in this cohort compared to 5.9 years for a sex- and age-matched U.S. At 1-, 3-, and 5-years of follow-up, the majority of survey respondents reported significant improvement in their general health status and physical activity levels. Renal failure (Hazard ratio [HR] 2.1, p<0.001), history of atrial fibrillation (HR 1.2, p=0.029), peripheral vascular disease (HR 1.2, p=0.026), cerebrovascular disease (1.2, p=0.022), moderate or severe chronic lung disease (HR 1.7, p<0.001), and concomitant tricuspid valve surgery (HR 1.5, p=0.0022) were independently associated with increased late mortality. Repeat valve surgery in octogenarians can be performed with excellent short- and long-term outcomes. Age alone should not be a contraindication to reoperation for patients requiring intervention for valvular disease.

Despite the growing number of vascular interventions performed in elderly patients, the functional outcomes regarding frailty remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the short term functional outcomes in pre-operative frail vs. non-frail patients following open vs. endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair. Patients aged ≥ 65 years and treated with elective open or endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair were included. They underwent the Groningen Frailty Indicator, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 4 m walk test, and handgrip strength (HGS) at three time points: pre-operatively and 1 and 6 months post-operatively. Linear mixed effect models were fitted to assess the effect of patient characteristics on the Groningen Frailty Indicator, MoCA, 4 m walk test, and HGS. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and corresponding baseline test scores. A minimum sample size of 80 patients was calculated. All functional assessments were completed by 85 patients. The mean age was 74.2 years, 37 patients (39%) were frail at baseline, and 65 patients (68%) were treated with endovascular repair. Frail patients showed greater improvement in frailty scores than non-frail patients (β = -0.21 per month, p < .001). Patients treated with endovascular repair deteriorated in frailty scores than those treated with open repair (β = 0.21 per month, p = .001). Overall, patients improved in MoCA score (β = 0.23, p = .011). Neither type of intervention nor frailty status were statistically significantly associated with changes in gait speed (β = 0.10 per month, p = .19; β = 0.07 per month, p = .29, respectively) or HGS (β = -0.11 per month, p = .35; β = -0.21 per month, p = .92, respectively). This study demonstrated that frailty is not necessarily associated with worse functional outcomes following open or endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

The Home Artificial Nutrition Unit (HANU) deals with both dysphagic patients receiving enteral and parenteral nutrition and patients who can eat orally with restrictions. In the Lazio Region, the HANU prescribes water gels and thickeners, supplied by the National Health Service (NHS), for safe hydration. Before the employment of a Speech and Language Pathologist (SLP) in the HANU (January 2023), prescriptions were standardized, regardless of the swallowing impairment severity: four jars of thickeners per patient/month and six water gels daily. The Clinical Swallowing Evaluation (CSE) made by the SLP allowed to customize the amount of thickeners and water gels based on the actual needs of the patient. The aim of this study is to investigate the cost savings resulting from the employment of an SLP in the HANU. A descriptive retrospective study was conducted, which analyzed the SLP activity in the HANU of ASL Roma 3 (January-December 2023). The study group consisted of 149 patients (61 males, 88 females with a mean age of 76.2 years) with different pathologies. The cost of each product (thickeners and gelified water) was provided by the Regional Pharmacy. The annual savings were calculated as the difference between the standardized prescription of products (as usual care in our department) and personalized prescription after SLP assessment. Since January 2023, there has been an increasing trend in requests for SLP assessments. The employment of an SLP in the HANU resulted in an annual economic saving of €30,278.67. This preliminary study shows how the employment of an SLP in the HANU can reduce inappropriate prescriptions of thickeners and water gels, thus ensuring cost savings.

Tissue homeostasis is dependent on precise coordination between endocrine organs in response to changes in organism physiology. Secreted circulating factors from adipocytes (called adipokines) regulate the behavior of stem cell lineages in peripheral tissues in multiple organisms. In addition to their endocrine roles, Drosophila adipocytes store and secrete amino acid storage proteins throughout development. During the larval feeding period, adipocytes secrete storage proteins into the hemolymph, which are reabsorbed by the adipose tissue during metamorphosis to control adult organ size and fertility. Despite the known functions for storage proteins during the larval stages, their requirement during Drosophila adulthood and reproduction are uncharacterized. We discover that adipocyte-specific knockdown of the storage proteins Larval serum protein 1 ( Lsp1 ) α/β/γ and Larval serum protein 2 ( Lsp2 ) results in a decrease in GSC maintenance. We further reveal that decreased GSC number is due to downregulation of Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling in GSCs, suggesting compromised amino acid sensing directly in GSCs. We also find that the proteins that mediate storage protein adipocyte reabsorption, Fat body protein 1 (Fbp1) and Fat body protein 2 (Fbp2), are expressed in ovarian follicle cells. Intriguingly, Fbp1 nor Fbp2 appear to be required in follicle cells for GSC maintenance, suggesting undiscovered requirements for amino acid storage proteins in oogenesis. Our results highlight a novel role for Drosophila amino acid storage proteins during adulthood and in regulating tissue stem cell lineages.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a rare inherited cardiac condition associated with a heightened risk of malignant arrhythmias, particularly during exposure to various pharmacological agents, including certain local anesthetics with sodium channel-blocking properties. This condition often generates significant concern among dental professionals, as the routine use of local anesthetics raises uncertainty about safety protocols and perceived medico-legal risks, frequently leading to patient refusal. The result is a silent yet systematic exclusion of these patients from standard pathways of care, with implications that extend beyond the clinical domain to encompass ethical, deontological, and social dimensions. We report the case of a 29-year-old male with BrS and a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator who underwent a conservative restorative dental procedure in a private outpatient clinic. Given the potential risk of arrhythmia during anesthetic infiltration, 4% articaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 was administered slowly and at the minimum effective dose under continuous cardiologic supervision, with real-time ECG and vital sign monitoring initiated prior to injection and maintained throughout the session. The treatment was completed uneventfully, with no ECG abnormalities observed. While limited to a single observation, this case illustrates that, under carefully controlled conditions and with appropriate precautions, outpatient dental management of patients with BrS may be considered a viable option in selected cases. This report includes a brief review of the literature and a focused discussion on the medico-legal implications to contextualize this case and support safe, ethical, and reproducible clinical decision-making in similar outpatient settings.

Anaphylaxis is a severe, rapidly progressing hypersensitivity reaction that requires prompt recognition and administration of intramuscular epinephrine. While guidelines recommend fixed-dose intramuscular epinephrine regardless of heart rate or blood pressure, there are situations where this approach may carry risks. We present the case of a 27-year-old patient with no prior comorbidities, including asthma, allergies, or cardiovascular conditions, who developed sudden breathlessness, generalized urticaria, and swelling of the face and lips shortly after taking oral cefpodoxime, a third-generation cephalosporin, prescribed for a febrile illness at a local hospital. On arrival at our hospital, the patient was conscious and alert, with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air, a heart rate of 169 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. The ABCDE (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) protocol was followed, and supportive care including oxygen, nebulized bronchodilators, and intravenous fluids was provided. Given the clear signs of anaphylaxis with marked tachycardia but no hypotension, there was a dilemma regarding the administration of standard intramuscular epinephrine due to concerns about worsening tachyarrhythmias. Under close monitoring, carefully titrated microdosed intravenous epinephrine was administered using a dilution protocol, resulting in rapid symptom improvement without cardiovascular instability. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring and supportive care and was later discharged in stable condition with oral antihistamines, corticosteroids, and clear instructions on allergen avoidance to prevent future emergencies. This case illustrates the need for clinical judgment when strict adherence to guidelines may pose a risk and demonstrates the role of individualized microdosed intravenous epinephrine in managing anaphylaxis in patients with significant tachycardia and normotension.

Caregiving for older adults often leads to increased social isolation and depression among primary caregivers. Secondary caregiver networks (SCNs) may provide crucial support, potentially mitigating these adverse outcomes. This study aimed to identify the SCN support patterns and examine their impacts on primary caregivers' social isolation and depression over 2 years, as well as potential differences in the associations by gender and race. Data from the 2015 and 2017 National Study of Caregiving (NSOC) and National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) were used. Latent profile analysis identified distinct SCN support patterns. Mixed-effects models assessed associations between SCN patterns, social isolation, and depression. Among 782 primary and 1,003 secondary caregivers, three SCN support patterns (low, medium, and high) were identified. Higher SCN support was associated with lower social isolation at baseline, but increased social isolation over time. Depression increased over time, but was not associated with SCN support. No significant gender and racial differences were found. While SCN support initially reduces social isolation among primary caregivers, its effectiveness diminishes over time. The study highlights the necessity for continuous social and mental health support for primary caregivers, regardless of SCN support level, to better address the evolving demands of caregiving.

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction is a frequently underdiagnosed contributor to chronic low back pain. Although fluoroscopic-guided SIJ injections remain the gold standard for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, their availability may be limited by insurance barriers or logistical constraints. In such cases, alternative approaches such as ultrasound-guided or landmark-based injections may offer practical, rapid solutions in outpatient settings. This case series aims to compare outcomes between landmark-based and fluoroscopic-guided SIJ injections in patients presenting with clinical findings suggestive of SIJ-related pain. Ten patients with suspected SIJ-related pain were identified based on a positive Fortin's Finger Test and FABERs examination. Five patients underwent landmark-based SIJ injections, performed by palpating the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) and directing the needle slightly inferior to this landmark. The remaining five patients received fluoroscopic-guided SIJ injections using standard imaging protocols. All injections consisted of 2 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine combined with 40 mg of triamcinolone. Pain relief was assessed at a 2-week follow-up using patient-reported percentage improvement. Among patients who underwent landmark-based injections, reported pain relief at two weeks was 50%, 40%, 50%, 90%, and 50%, with an average relief of 56%. In contrast, patients receiving fluoroscopic-guided injections reported pain relief of 80%, 50%, 75%, 100%, and 75%, with an average relief of 76%. No procedural complications were reported in either group. Fluoroscopic-guided SIJ injections were associated with greater and more consistent pain relief at short-term follow-up. However, landmark-based injections provided meaningful clinical benefit in the majority of patients and may serve as a practical option when immediate intervention is needed, particularly when imaging resources are unavailable or delayed due to insurance approval. The absence of complications in either group supports the relative safety of both approaches when performed by trained interventionalists. Notably, we maintain that fluoroscopic-guided injections remain the gold standard and should be utilized to confirm sacroiliac joint pain or when assessing patients for potential advanced interventions. While fluoroscopic guidance offers superior accuracy and therapeutic efficacy for SIJ injections, landmark-based techniques can be a viable solution in specific clinical scenarios. Fluoroscopic-guided injections remain the gold standard and should be utilized to confirm sacroiliac joint pain or when assessing patients for potential advanced interventions.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between ankle joint function and walking performance in older adults by assessing qualitative ankle functions through torque fluctuation analysis and tibialis anterior (TA) intramuscular coherence during isometric dorsiflexion. Thirty-eight community-dwelling older adults participated in this study. Ankle torque fluctuations and intramuscular coherence were evaluated during a dorsiflexion task at 30% of maximum voluntary torque (MVT). Walking performance was assessed using the 5-meter walk test and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Torque fluctuation indicators, including the coefficient of variation (CV), frequency components, and the primary component calculated by an autoregressive (AR) model, were derived from time-series data. Intramuscular coherence was analyzed in the δ (0-5 Hz) and β (16-35 Hz) frequency bands. Multiple regression analyses adjusted for age were conducted to explore associations between walking performance, torque indicators, and intramuscular coherence. The TUG test demonstrated a significant relationship with the AR principal component of torque fluctuations, independent of age (p = 0.031), suggesting that temporal variability in ankle torque contributes to dynamic balance. While no significant relationship was observed between gait function and intramuscular coherence, δ-band coherence showed significant correlations with torque variability (CV, r = 0.598, p < 0.001) and spectral power in both the 0.5-5 Hz (r = 0.62, p < 0.001) and 5-10 Hz (r = 0.544, p = 0.001) bands. The AR principal component appears to capture kinematic features to motor control and dynamic balance, as evidenced by its association with TUG performance. Furthermore, the relationship between δ-band coherence and torque fluctuations highlights its potential as a maker of neuromuscular function. Although torque fluctuation characteristics and δ-band coherence did not directly correlate with walking speed, they offer valuable insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning motor control. This study demonstrated that temporal variability in ankle torque, as quantified by the AR principal component, contributes to walking ability and dynamic balance in older adults.

"Physical training influences competitive marathon performance, including training volume and training frequency changes (TFCs) pre-race. Training intensity distribution (i.e., steady-state, quality sessions, interval training) and cross-training contribute to volume and TFCs that may influence performance. The aim of this study is to assess the relationships among training and TFCs preceding the 2022 Boston Marathon and race performance. Adult 2022 Boston Marathon registrants were contacted via email 1 month pre-race. Athletes reported demographics, training/racing experience, and training pre-race. TFCs were calculated by comparing two timeframes: 12-4 and 4-0 month pre-race training. Official race performance was obtained from chip timing data and demographics. Separate linear regressions were used to assess the effects of training and cross-training in 12-4 and 4-0 months pre-race and TFCs on performance, accounting for experience and demographics. In total, 917 athletes were included (female: n = 495, 3:53 ± 0:37 h race times, 64.4 ± 24 km/week weekly distance; male: n = 422; 3:35 ± 0:39 h race times, 67.6 ± 26.2 km/week weekly distance). Higher running distance/week, running sessions/week (n), quality sessions/week (""hard sessions""; n), average distance in the 12-4 and 4-0 months pre-race (p ≤ 0.050), and more cross-training (p < 0.001) in the 4-0 months pre-race were associated with faster times and performance. Runners with TFCs of decreased running sessions/week (p = 0.035) had faster times and better performance versus athletes who maintained/increased volume. Habitually higher training exposure 12-4 and 4-0 months, but relatively reduced training frequency 4-0 months pre-race, contributed to better marathon performance."

Simulations suggest that displacement of rectus extraocular muscle pulleys in superior oblique (SO) palsy accounts for incomitant strabismus patterns even without postulating SO contractile weakness. We asked how rectus extraocular muscle pulleys reorient during head tilt in SO palsy. In 13 subjects with unilateral SO palsy, supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 2-mm-thick quasi-coronal planes in target-controlled central gaze was repeated in both lateral decubitus positions equivalent to 90° head tilts. From extraocular muscle centroids, we computed oculocentric pulley coordinates and compartmental posterior partial volumes (PPVs) of the rectus and SO muscles. Validating atrophy, PPV of the palsied SO was smaller than its fellow (P < 10-4). In fellow orbits, the array of all four rectus pulleys exhibited counter-rotation during head tilt (P < 0.03), averaging 5.9°. The palsied pulley array was in both tilts excyclorotated relative to the fellow orbit, particularly by 4° to 5° for horizontal rectus pulleys (P < 0.03), and also counter-rotated with head tilt similarly to the fellow orbit. Differential compartmental changes in PPV were significant in the lateral and superior rectus and SO muscles of the fellow orbit that were consistent with observed torsion, but were absent in the palsied orbit. Similar counter-rotation of the rectus pulley array during head tilt occurs in both eyes in unilateral SO palsy, but superimposed on excyclorotation of the array in the palsied orbit. Differential compartmental change in PPV occurs during head tilt in the lateral and superior rectus muscles of the fellow but not palsied orbit and could augment ocular counter-rolling.

Hibernomas are infrequent brown adipose tissue tumors that can mimic various other soft tissue tumors, both malignant and benign, and multiple imaging modalities are usually used in the diagnostic approach. We present the case of a 30-year-old female patient who was initially diagnosed with a mediastinal hibernoma through complete excisional biopsy in 2022 and underwent surgical resection at that time. She required a second surgical intervention in 2024 due to recurrence and is now being evaluated for a second recurrence using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT), reporting an extensive polylobulated mediastinal tumor intercalating normometabolic and discretely hypermetabolic zones. Hibernomas consist of a combination of brown adipose tissue and normal adult adipose tissue. The brown adipose tissue has a higher glucose metabolism, leading to increased 18F-FDG uptake and significant radiotracer accumulation. A multidisciplinary approach is important. The use of 18F-FDG PET/CT is valuable in hibernoma evaluation, as it can detect increased metabolism compared to other tissues. This provides additional information that can complement other imaging studies. However, it is important to interpret these results carefully, as they can raise concerns for false-positive metastasis. Given the infrequent nature and somewhat difficult diagnosis, there is yet much to learn about hibernomas.

Ayurveda recommends a comprehensive therapeutic approach for osteoarthritis management. However, most of the published clinical studies on Ayurveda interventions for osteoarthritis management have addressed selected modalities of Ayurveda treatment rather than the holistic therapeutic regimen. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a multimodal Ayurveda treatment protocol in the long-term management of primary osteoarthritis of the knee compared with standard care. The proposed open-label, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted in individuals of any gender aged 40 to 70 years and diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis of the knee as per the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Individuals with grade 4 radiographic changes in the affected knee (based on the Kellgren-Lawrence classification) and with comorbidities were not considered. The study was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. A total of 150 participants underwent random assignment in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the Ayurveda treatment protocol or conventional standard care for 180 days. The primary outcome was the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score from baseline. The secondary outcome measures included the change in the score for pain, stiffness, and physical function from baseline; change in the range of motion of the knee joint; change in the score of the numeric pain rating scale, Pain Disability Index, and 12-item short-form survey questionnaire (to assess health-related quality of life); change in highly sensitive C-reactive protein levels, interleukin-6 levels, magnetic resonance imaging scan findings, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan findings; and change in the need for rescue analgesic medication from baseline. Safety was evaluated by recording the incidence of adverse events and changes in liver and kidney function tests from baseline. Recruitment of study participants commenced on October 11, 2022. Currently, all the participants completed the study and the analysis of the study outcomes is ongoing. This randomized controlled trial will be the first study to explore the potential benefits of a multimodal Ayurveda regimen (based on Ayurveda principles and scientific evidence) in the long-term management of osteoarthritis of the knee through validated subjective, laboratory, and imaging parameters. The outcomes of this study may address the needs and challenges associated with osteoarthritis management.

In addition, there is a set of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients whose phenotype fall into between heterozygous FH and HoFH. Recently, the International Atherosclerosis Society reclassified such patients with FH as ""severe FH."" Given that we have several different treatment approaches for these FH patients, including those with HoFH, it is quite important to reclassify them according to their severity of phenotype and types of complications.

Background: Palliative support has been shown to improve the quality of end-of-life care provided in long-term care facilities (LTCF). In this context, a practice improvement plan, which included creating a withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment (WLST) protocol, has been developed and implemented in our LTCF. We aimed to compare professional practices before and after the implementation of this improvement plan. Methods: The study population included all individuals who died in 2018 and in 2021. A clinical audit noted if WLST was decided and which palliative interventions were deployed. Results: WLST decisions were significantly more frequently taken in 2021 than in 2018, with a longer interval between the decisions and death, as well as fewer transfers to acute care facilities. Conclusions: Identifying and managing end-of-life situations more frequently leads to shared WLST decisions, which allow for more effective cessation of interventions and fewer transfers during the last month of life.

A total of 122 out of 371 cases were selected for inclusion in this study. A defendant verdict was reached in 84 (69 %) cases and a plaintiff-verdict in 23 (19 %) cases. Fifteen (12 %) cases were settled. The mean indemnity payment and settlement award were $2.39 million and $662 thousand, respectively. Discontinuation or failure to initiate post-discharge anticoagulation therapy was cited in 25 % of cases. The most common basis of litigation was diagnostic/therapeutic delay (42 %) and inadequate VTE prophylaxis (39 %). Death was the most frequently reported complication (64 %). Patient-reported pain and suffering was associated with a defendant verdict (p = 0.0204). The choice of anticoagulant was not found to increase the risk of a plaintiff-favorable verdict (p = 0.6754). Malpractice cases related to VTE in orthopaedic surgery are associated with substantial financial liability and arise in the setting of delayed diagnosis of VTE or failure to initiate thromboprophylaxis. Current medicolegal trends do not indicate a preference for any specific VTE prophylactic agent. Implementing a systems-based strategy to optimize transitions of care may help reduce both the incidence of VTE and the associated risk of litigation."

"Despite the therapeutic potential of the primary vaccine series, a lack of confidence in the COVID-19 booster vaccine poses a threat to public health and undermines its coverage at the national, regional, and global levels. This study aimed to understand COVID-19 booster vaccine confidence (CBVC) among Bangladeshi adults aged 18-49 and the potential predictors of CBVC. In line with STROBE guidelines, a face-to-face cross-sectional survey was conducted from June 15 to August 31, 2023 during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. A one-way ANOVA analysis, independent-sample t-test, and binary logistic regression were employed to assess the potential antecedents associated with CBVC. The pooled COVID-19 booster vaccine confidence was 74.3 % (95 % CI, 71.1-77.6 %) among adult polls. Majority of participants were confident that booster vaccinations are safe (64.9 %) and effective (53.8 %) against new SARS-CoV-2 variants, with 74.0 % stating that they were trusted by vaccination services. Out of the ten potential factors, ""equal safety"" and ""trust"" had a highly significant positive association with CBVC ([aOR]: 2.164 and [aOR]: 2.054, respectively). Binary analysis also revealed that ""effectiveness"" and ""social care"" had a significant positive association with CBVC ([aOR]: 1.051 and [aOR]: 1.209, respectively). In the t-test analysis, females felt more responsible for getting the booster vaccine to protect others (t = -4.21, P = 0.001), however, they also worried about unwanted side effects (t = -4.79, P = 0.001). The post-hoc comparison found that being younger and having a lower education was associated with a lower level of confidence in booster vaccines and trust. This study reported high confidence in the COVID-19 booster vaccine, but there were noticeable demographic and psychological differences in booster confidence. The provision of accurate, up-to-date information from reliable sources, as well as education about the safety and efficacy of vaccines might improve CBVC coverage among marginalized populations."

Compared with controls, women with type 1 diabetes had significantly reduced LV end-diastolic volume index: 64.2±11.1 mL/m2 vs 77.6±13.9 mL/m2 (p<0.001), reduced end-systolic volume index: 26.0±7.3 mL/m2 vs 33.5±7.7 mL/m2 (p=0.003), increased concentricity: 0.84±0.13 g/mL vs 0.68±0.10 g/mL (p<0.001), reduced stroke volume index: 38.2±7.2 mL/m2 vs 44.1±8.4 mL/m2 (p=0.008), reduced cardiac index: 3.37±0.55 L/min/m2 vs 3.62±0.51 L/min/m2 (p=0.046), reduced global longitudinal strain: -13.5±2.3% vs -15.2±2.1% (p=0.04), increased myocardial T1 values: 998±28 ms vs 983±25 ms (p=0.03), increased systolic blood pressure: 128.1±7.8 mmHg vs 117.4±11.1 mmHg (p=0.007), increased mean arterial pressure: 94.8±6.7 mmHg vs 88.1±9.7 mmHg (p=0.03), increased total peripheral vascular resistance: 28.9±5.3 mmHg·min·m2/L vs 24.7±4.0 mmHg·min·m2/L (p=0.001), and reduced total arterial compliance: 0.79±0.19 mL/m2/mmHg vs 1.02±0.21 mL/m2/mmHg (p<0.001). Our study provides evidence of impaired LV remodelling and suboptimal vascular adaptation to pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes when compared to women without diabetes. The clinical implications of these findings, particularly their association with the development of later cardiovascular disease, require further investigation.

Nickel exposure elevates aortic dissection (AD) risk, yet its pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that nickel accelerates AD progression, particularly in hypertensive individuals. Bioinformatics analysis of GEO datasets identified chemokine-mediated endothelial-neutrophil crosstalk as a key pathway. Using a neutrophil-endothelial co-culture model, nickel activated the CXCL6/CXCL8-CXCR2 axis, triggering endothelial secretion of CXCL6/8 and upregulating neutrophil CXCR2 expression. This dual effect promoted neutrophil recruitment, adhesion, and migration, validated in nickel-exposed AD model mice and a case-control study. Nickel further induced neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation via myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Citrullinated Histone H3 (CitH3) activation, compromising endothelial integrity through decreased Occludin/ZO-1 protein levels. Our findings reveal nickel-driven AD pathogenesis involves: CXCL6/8-CXCR2-mediated neutrophil recruitment, and NETosis-induced endothelial barrier disruption. This mechanistically links environmental nickel exposure to AD progression via neutrophil-endothelial dysregulation, providing critical insights for mitigating heavy metal-associated cardiovascular hazards.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 3 months of seated Tai Chi (TC) practice on the eye-hand coordination and sitting balance control of subjects with Parkinson's disease. A prospective non-randomized study was conducted with 29 subjects practicing TC and 27 subjects as controls according to their preference. The seated TC group underwent 3 months of training with a total of 24 sessions (1hour/session, 2 sessions/week). The outcome measures included a dynamic finger pointing task (reaction time, movement time, and accuracy), and a sequential weight shifting balance control test (completion time) while seated. The TC group showed faster movement time in the dynamic finger pointing task (p = 0.003). They also achieved a faster completion time of the sequential weight shifting balance test (p = 0.021). No significant difference was observed in the control group. The results demonstrate that 3 months of seated TC training could improve movement time in the finger pointing task and sitting balance control in subjects with Parkinson's disease. A future randomized controlled trial is warranted.

Digital cognitive assessments offer a promising approach to monitoring cognitive impairments, but repeated use can introduce practice effects, potentially masking changes in cognitive status. We evaluated practice effects using the Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA), a digital battery designed for cognitive monitoring. We analyzed data from 116 participants from the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, comparing response times across two DANA sessions, around 90 days apart, while controlling for cognitive status, sex, age, and education. Modest practice effects were found, and cognitive impairment was associated with slower response times in several tasks. Classification models, including logistic regression and random forest classification, achieved accuracies of up to 71% in assessing cognitive status. Our study establishes a framework for evaluating practice effects in digital cognitive assessment tools. Future work should expand the sample size and diversity to enhance the generalizability of findings in broader clinical contexts. We systematically evaluated practice effects using the DANA battery as a case study. Modest practice effects were observed across two testing sessions, with a median inter-session interval of 93 days. Cognitive impairment was significantly associated with slower response times in key tasks (p < 0.001). Our framework offers a systematic approach for evaluating practice effects in digital cognitive tools.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) are the two primary renal replacement therapies for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While PD is an effective and convenient modality, long-term use can lead to ultrafiltration failure, recurrent peritonitis, and progressive structural alterations in the peritoneal membrane, necessitating a transition to HD. In recent years, rather than a complete transition, the combined use of PD and HD has emerged as a viable alternative, offering potential advantages for selected patient populations.This retrospective study included patients with PD-related complications, such as resistant hypervolemia, frequent peritonitis episodes, peritoneal failure, and clinical deterioration. Based on eligibility criteria, patients were either transitioned to HD or initiated on combined PD+HD therapy. A total of 28 patients underwent transition to HD, while 26 received PD+HD combination therapy. Survival rates, Kt/V, residual urine output, and various laboratory parameters were evaluated and compared between the two groups. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in Kt/V, volume stabilization, and cardiovascular stability after transitioning from PD. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in laboratory parameters between the two groups. These findings suggest that for patients experiencing PD failure, frequent peritonitis, or fluid overload, combined PD+HD therapy may serve as a feasible alternative to conventional HD. Careful patient selection and individualized treatment planning are crucial for optimizing outcomes. Given its comparable efficacy to HD, combined PD+HD therapy may represent an important option for patients requiring a tailored approach to dialysis.

Ultrasound technology has advanced regional anesthesia and pain management, by improving accuracy and reducing complication rates. We have successfully performed cryoablation of intercostal nerves with ultrasound guidance with no complications. Four patients with postthoracotomy pain syndrome had pain relief for at least 1 mo after selective cryoablation of intercostal nerves at the mid-axillary line. Visualizing the pleura during the procedure is the greatest benefit of using ultrasonography, especially in thin patients whose intercostal groove to pleural distance may be <0.5 cm. Although further studies are needed, we feel that this new technique should reduce the risk of pneumothorax as well as improve the success of cryoablation.

Ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphoma (OAMZL) is the most common subtype of primary ocular lymphoma and has been rising in incidence in Asian populations. We conducted a retrospective review of 95 patients diagnosed with OAMZL within a multi-ethnic cohort from Singapore. Clinical characteristics, survival outcomes including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on staging F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18-FDG-PET/CT) were investigated. The cohort comprised 60 males and 35 females, with a median age of 58 years (25 - 88). Median follow-up was 92 months. The most common sites involved were the orbit (49.5%) and lacrimal gland (23.2%). Most patients presented with stage 1 disease (72.6%). Five-year OS and PFS for the whole cohort were 94.9% and 84.1%, respectively. Factors significantly associated with poorer OS included advanced (stage 2-4) disease (hazard ratio (HR) 6.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.69 - 23.19, P = 0.0061), older age above 58 years (HR = 15.29, 95% CI: 4.47 - 52.3, P < 0.0001), and higher mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue International Prognostic Index (MALT-IPI) scores of 2 - 3 compared to low (0) and intermediate (1) scores (HR = 9.28, 95% CI: 1.24 - 69.11, P < 0.0001 and HR = 10.99, 95% CI: 1.34 - 89.94, P < 0.0001), respectively. Older age (HR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.07 - 5.43, P = 0.0330) and advanced disease (HR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.07 - 7.03, P = 0.0348) were significantly associated with poorer PFS. Median SUVmax of the lesions was 5.6 (2.1 - 9.6), with significantly higher values in advanced disease. Our study illustrates the favorable prognosis of OAMZL in an Asian cohort, although particular factors may portend worse survival outcomes.

Higher area socioeconomic level was associated with a decreased risk of romosozumab discontinuation during COVID-19 lockdown among U.S. Medicare beneficiaries. Patients in these areas were more likely to restart osteoporosis treatment post-discontinuation. Timely support for vulnerable patients is crucial for improving adherence during public health crises. To evaluate the association between area socioeconomic (SES) vulnerability and the discontinuation of romosozumab and the impact of the COVID lockdown on osteoporosis treatment among women enrolled in the U.S. Medicare who initiated romosozumab. Female Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older who initiated romosozumab between April 2019 and September 2020 were included. Discontinuation was defined as a > 60-day gap between doses. SES vulnerability was assessed using the county-level Social Vulnerability Index SES theme. A Discontinuation Risk Score (DcRS) was calculated to control for individual characteristics. A Cox proportional hazards model evaluated the association between county SES and discontinuation. Secondary analyses examined treatment restart within six months post-discontinuation. The study included 6,777 new romosozumab users. Higher area SES level (lower vulnerability) was associated with a reduced risk of discontinuation during the COVID-19 lockdown (adjusted HR = 0.79 [0.68, 0.92] for the highest vs. lowest SES). Of 2,937 patients who discontinued, 1,816 restarted osteoporosis treatments within 6 months, including 661 switching to other medications. Patients in the highest SES group were more likely to restart osteoporosis treatment during lockdown (adjusted HR = 1.14 [1.01-1.30]) comparing with the lowest SES group, which is primarily driven by treatment switch (adjusted HR = 1.30 [1.06-1.60]). Medicare beneficiaries in counties with higher SES level (lower vulnerability) were less likely to discontinue romosozumab during the COVID-19 lockdown and more likely to switch treatments if discontinued, resulting in shorter treatment gaps. Providing timely support to vulnerable patients is vital for maintaining treatment adherence during future public health emergencies.

This study aimed to compare the treatment plan between free breathing (FB) and deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) in patients with left-sided breast cancer. We aimed to investigate the dose to the heart and left lung. Fifty-five patients with left-sided breast cancer treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy were retrospectively compared with those planned with FB and DIBH in terms of doses to the heart and left lung. The prescribed dose was 42.56 Gy which was delivered in 16 fractions. Compared with FB, DIBH effectively reduced the mean dose to the heart by an average of 55% (2.0 Gy vs. 0.9 Gy, p < 0.001). DIBH resulted in significantly greater left lung volumes, with an average of 74.7% (980.5 cc vs. 1713.0 cc, p < 0.001). The DIBH plan delivered a significantly lower relative volume to the left lung, with an average of 1.6% at V20Gy (11.7% vs. 10.1%, p < 0.001) but delivered a significantly higher absolute irradiated volume to the left lung at V20Gy, with an average of 45.9% (118.2 cc vs. 172.5 cc, p < 0.001). DIBH is an effective treatment technique for reducing the dose to the heart and the relative irradiated left lung volume for left-sided breast cancer, although the absolute irradiated left lung volume is increased.

Candida albicans (C. albicans) is a common opportunistic fungal pathogen that poses a serious threat to human health. Autophagy inhibition decreased the resistance of C. albicans. This study investigated the antifungal activity of autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) against C. albicans biofilms and its synergistic potential with antifungal drug, and the underlying mechanisms. The inhibitory effect of CQ on C. albicans biofilms was determined using the XTT assay. The interactions between CQ and antifungal drugs were evaluated using the FICI and ΔE models. The in vivo efficacy and biosafety were assessed in a murine model with oral candidiasis. The antifungal effects were further evaluated through time-kill assays, live/dead staining, and scanning electron microscopy. The autophagic regulation was analyzed using the expression of autophagy-related genes and proteins, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and an ATG9 deletion strain was used to confirm the involvement. CQ exhibited antifungal activity against both standard and drug-resistant C. albicans strains, and showed significant synergy with amphotericin B (AmB). In vivo, CQ alone or in combination with AmB effectively against oral candidiasis in mice with good biosafety. Mechanistically, CQ alone or combined with AmB downregulated autophagy-related gene and protein expression, elevated ROS levels, and suppressed ALP activity. Consistently, ATG9 deletion reduced CQ efficacy in vitro and vivo, confirming CQ's antifungal effect via autophagy inhibition. CQ enhances antifungal activity against C. albicans biofilms in vitro and in vivo by inducing oxidative stress and inhibiting autophagy, and exhibits synergistic effects with AmB.

The two hemostatic agents utilized for reversal of life-threatening hemorrhage associated with Factor Xa (fXa) inhibition are andexanet alfa (AA) and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC). In May 2018, AA was approved with possible superior short-term hemostatic efficacy but has been linked with higher rates of thrombotic events. Considering these concerns, the absence of high-quality comparative studies, and the higher cost compared to other agents, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate remained the more utilized agent. There is a critical need for real-world data from large-scale databases describing the reversal of fXa inhibitors using AA compared to 4F-PCC to determine their time to hemostatic treatment and its effect on patient outcomes and mortality. This was a national retrospective cohort from the Veteran Health Administration of AA or 4 F-PCC usage between January 1, 2018 to January 1, 2024. The primary endpoint was time to hemostatic treatment. The secondary endpoints were 30-day thrombotic events and 90-day mortality, which were validated through manual chart review. Demographic and treatment variables were summarized using descriptive statistics. The two sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test was utilized on the primary endpoint. A multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between 90-day mortality and time to hemostatic treatment. There were 19,015 Veterans with ICH; 246 (AA n = 89; 4F-PCC n = 157) of the Veterans that received an fXa inhibitor within 180 days in the emergency department were included in the study. Most Veterans were male (96.4 %) and elderly. Apixaban was the most utilized anticoagulant, and intracerebral hemorrhage was the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). There was no difference in the primary endpoint of time to hemostatic treatment between the groups (AA group median: 203 min (IQR 140-283) vs. 4F-PCC median: 200 min (IQR 137-299), p = 0.70). 90-day mortality was 19.1 % where the odds of 90-day mortality increased by 0.4 % for each additional minute of time to hemostatic agent administration (odds ratio [OR] 1.004, 95 % confidence interval ([CI] 1.001-1.006). In Veterans with fXa inhibitor-related ICH receiving AA or 4F-PCC, there was no difference between AA and 4F-PCC in time to hemostatic treatment. Time to hemostatic agent administration increased odds of 90-mortality by 0.4 % for every minute, but did not differ depending on the hemostatic agent used.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the survival outcomes of dental implants placed in the pterygoid region and assess the potential influence of multiple clinical variables on their survival. A retrospective chart review was conducted on pterygoid implants placed over a 9-year period at the University of Connecticut Department of Prosthodontics. All pterygoid implants were placed by a single board-certified prosthodontist following a standardized surgical protocol. The implants were restored by various clinicians during the 9-year period. Data collected included implant size and type, loading protocol, surgical and prosthetic complications, patient gender, presence of parafunctional habits, and type of opposing dentition. A life table was used to calculate interval survival rates (ISR) and cumulative survival rates (CSR) of pterygoid implants. A total of 102 pterygoid implants placed in 69 patients (32 males, 37 females) were eligible for this retrospective study. The mean follow-up time was 34.35 months. A total of five implant failures were observed, resulting in a cumulative survival rate of 94.74%. All implant failures occurred within the first 4 to 5 months following implant placement and prior to any functional loading, suggesting a failure to achieve osseointegration. No intraoperative complications were noted, and only one postoperative surgical complication was observed, which was successfully managed without further issue. Roughened surface implants placed in the pterygoid region offer favorable implant survival of 95% with minimal complications.

"This study utilized a retrospective, population-based cohort of administrative records of 167,319 children who attended school in British Columbia, Canada. The outcomes of standardized English, math, and science exam scores, as well as high school graduation were examined. The associations between poverty and educational outcomes at high school were found to be complex. Children experiencing both household and neighbourhood poverty (i.e., ""combined"" poverty) at age 13 had significantly lower English, math, and science exam scores at grade 10, as well as having higher odds to not graduate before age 20. The effect of combined poverty was larger than household poverty only or neighbourhood poverty only for English exam scores and for graduating. However, the association between poverty with math or science outcome scores was mixed. Experiencing neighbourhood poverty only was generally associated with lower performance in educational outcomes across children of different immigrant generation status (non-immigrant, first-generation, second-generation), immigration admission category (economic, family, refugee), or region of origin (East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, South Asia). However, children of specific immigration backgrounds who experienced household-only poverty appeared to score better on math exams in comparison to children who did not experience poverty from those same groups. Intervention and prevention efforts to reduce childhood poverty that also include immigrant-specific considerations could potentially improve children's educational outcomes.

Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality globally, often presenting with insidious symptoms that lead to late-stage diagnoses, underscoring the critical need for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. One such avenue is the exploration of ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death implicated in various pathological conditions and malignancies. In this study, we demonstrate that brucine, an alkaloid derived from Strychnos nux-vomica, exerts significant antitumor effects on GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Brucine treatment dose-dependently inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis and ferroptosis. Specifically, brucine treatment diminished cell viability, DNA synthesis, and colony formation, increased the expression of proapoptotic markers such as Bax, and decreased the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2. Additionally, brucine inhibited migration and invasion by modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. In ferroptosis assays, brucine potentiated the effects of the ferroptosis inducer Erastin, elevating levels of intracellular iron, malondialdehyde, and reactive oxygen species, while reducing glutathione levels. In vivo experiments showed that brucine markedly reduced tumor growth and modified the expression of key biomarkers in a xenograft model. Furthermore, our findings suggest that brucine's effects on cancer cell behavior and ferroptosis are associated with suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway, suggesting an indirect modulation of this pathway. In conclusion, this study elucidates the comprehensive antitumor properties of brucine against GC, highlighting its ability to inhibit cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptotic and ferroptotic pathways. These effects are potentially mediated through indirect modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.

Microglia, brain-resident immune cells, are involved in pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Given significant species-specific differences in microglia gene expression, particularly in disease-risk genes, as well as the highly reactive nature of these cells, studying human microglia in a whole brain environment is essential. Here, we established a humanized mouse model by transplanting human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells into the striatum of immunodeficient adult mice and injected human alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils to model Parkinson's disease pathology. Transplanted human cells engraft, mature into microglia and maintain their phenotype for at least three months post-transplantation. These human microglia interact with alpha-synuclein, significantly limiting its propagation from the striatum to the substantia nigra and further reducing local small aggregates; they also mildly protect tyrosine hydroxylase neurons there. Transcriptomic profiling reveals 56 differentially expressed genes in human microglia in response to alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils, while host mouse cells show 202 gene expression changes, including an upregulation of gene Hcrt (fold change = 7.77, p = 0.0015). Immunohistochemistry analysis further confirms the preservation of hypocretin-positive neurons in the hypothalamus of the transplanted mice (p = 0.0079). The findings highlight the neuroprotective role of human microglia and establish a more disease-relevant in vivo model for investigating alpha-synuclein aggregation and therapeutic interventions in Parkinson's disease.

With more women entering the medical workforce, caregiving challenges and family-work conflicts are of growing importance to today's neurologists. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of caregiver (CG) status on academic achievements in neurology, analyze the division of labor and time devoted to domestic responsibilities, and measure family-work conflict in US academic neurology faculty. A total of 19 US neurology departments completed a survey on baseline demographics, academic achievements, CG status, division of domestic time and labor, and responses on a FWC scale. Variables were assessed using independent samples t tests (or Mann-Whitney U for non-normally distributed data) and X2 analyses as appropriate, with CGs vs noncaregivers (N-CGs) serving as the independent groups. Women were twice as likely as men to categorize themselves as caregivers (p = 0.005). There were no significant differences in academic achievements between the CG and N-CG groups. However, CG men had a statistically significantly higher number of leadership positions (p = 0.022), number of publications as first or last author (p = 0.020), and number of awards (p = 0.004) when compared with CG women. The percentage of CG women faculty who reported spending more than 22 hours per week on child care was significantly higher than that of CG men (p = 0.003). Caregiver women also reported doing more work at home; taking care of children when they are sick; taking days off work when children are sick; handling more chores related to child care (e.g., managing activities/schedules); and doing laundry, cooking, and cleaning related to child care. Finally, the CG group experienced a higher level of FWC, as evidenced by responses on the FWC scale (p < 0.001). This finding was same for CG women compared with CG men (p = 0.034). Although the caregiving burden did not directly affect academic productivity, it significantly increased FWC in US academic neurology faculty surveyed. Female CG faculty disproportionately shouldered domestic and household responsibilities. Beyond recognizing CG challenges, advocating for a change in paradigm and providing solutions to these pervasive issues could be instrumental in preventing further attrition of professionals from our field, particularly women with caregiving roles.

Hypertension is the single most important modifiable risk factor for preventable disability and death worldwide and disproportionately affects socially disadvantaged populations. We face a paradox-blood pressure control is low and recent trends suggest it is even declining, despite the availability of inexpensive and effective therapies. A variety of barriers on the system, patient, and healthcare provider side hinder effective drug-based risk factor management. Clinical inertia represents a major barrier on the clinician side, as well as workload and limited education. Common barriers on the patient side include limited English proficiency, low health literacy, and nonadherence with misaligned incentives, limited resources, lack of structured clinical pathways, and reimbursement issues. New innovations in the field of RNA-targeted therapies and device-based interventions could prevent and potentially even cure diseases previously designated as chronic health conditions, such as hypertension. Such novel therapies could potentially overcome several major barriers to effective treatment, including nonadherence. Drug development of novel, long-acting treatments requires consideration of specific clinical trial design aspects, including safety collection, benefit: risk assessment, the development and assessment of novel, qualitative surrogate end points, such as time-in-therapeutic range, the use of representative trial settings as well as the definition of standard of care in placebo-controlled trials, which should be of reasonably high-quality allowing for credible evaluation of effectiveness. Here, we provide an overview on barriers to effective treatment and a framework for trials assessing novel treatments for cardiovascular disease risk factors, including early and broad implementation programs.

A retrospective review of adult patients who received a fluoroscopically guided TSNRI for a HNP was performed. Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) domains of Physical Function (PF), Pain Interference (PI), and Depression (D) were collected at baseline and post-procedure short-term (1-3 months post-procedure) and long-term follow-up (6-12 months post-procedure). PROMIS PF at short- and long-term follow-up statistically improved by 1.9 (p = 0.02) and 4.6 (p = 0.01) points respectively. PROMIS PI at short- and long-term follow-up statistically improved by 3.7 (p < 0.001) and 5.9 (p - 0.002) points respectively. Depression scores improved by 2.7 (p = 0.04) at short-term follow-up but long-term follow-up scores did not significantly differ from baseline scores. 91 (85%) of patients did not elect for spine surgical consultation. Our study demonstrated that lumbosacral TFESI was associated with a long-term improvement in function and pain for patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy due to a HNP as measured by PROMIS PF and PI survey and obviated the need for spine surgery at long-term follow-up.

Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) plays a critical role in the transmigration of peripheral monocytes, a central mechanism underlying chronic inflammation. In this study, we investigate postoperative serum kinetics of MCP-1 as a potential contributor to postoperative neurocognitive decline, arteriosclerosis, and the development of organ failures. Seventy-one patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were included in this study. Serum samples were collected preoperatively (tbaseline), and postoperatively at 24 h (t24h), 7 days (t7d), and 3 months (t3m). MCP-1 levels were quantified in conjunction with other inflammatory markers and alarmins. Whole blood samples underwent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to evaluate MCP-1 production capacity, and peripheral monocyte transcriptomes were analyzed. Surrogate markers of end-organ dysfunction, including markers of neurodegeneration, neuroinjury, vasculitis, and atherosclerosis, were assessed. Acute kidney failure was defined per the RIFLE criteria, and occurrences of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and dispositions were documented. Cardiac surgery resulted in an acute increase in serum MCP-1 at 24 h, 7 days, and 3 months as compared to the presurgical baseline. MCP-4 levels were unchanged, while Regulated on Activation Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted cytokine (RANTES) was significantly depleted after surgery. Except for a prior history of cerebrovascular accidents, other preoperative clinical conditions, duration of anesthesia, surgery, cross-clamp, estimated fluid loss, and transfusions did not influence t24h MCP-1 serum level. Perioperative use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids affected acute serum MCP-1 levels. At 3 months, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery exhibited the most pronounced elevation in MCP-1 compared to other cardiac surgery. Serum IL-6 at 24 h positively correlated with MCP-1 levels measured at 24 h, 7 days, and 3 months. Additionally, markers of neurodegeneration (τ protein and amyloid β-1-40), some vascular inflammation (FGF-23 and FGF-21), and atherosclerosis (LOX-1) demonstrated correlational relationships with MCP-1. Finally, patients experiencing postoperative cerebrovascular accidents demonstrated depressed levels of MCP-1 at 24 h, 7 days, and 3 months as compared to patients recovering uneventfully. Serum MCP-1 levels were elevated for up to 3 months following cardiac surgery, even in patients who experienced an uneventful recovery. MCP-4 was unchanged, while RANTES depressed post-surgery. A significant correlation between MCP-1 and serum surrogate markers of brain injury, vascular inflammation, and atherosclerosis highlights MCP-1 as a potential biomarker and a possible mediator of adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery.

An improved rotational characterization of the E3Σ1+(63S1) Rydberg state of the CdAr diatom produced in a supersonic beam and studied using laser induced fluorescence (LIF) excitation spectra is presented. As an example, the spectra of the E3Σ1+←A3Π0+(53P1) transition, originating from the excitation of a single 116Cd40Ar isotopologue, are recorded and analyzed. In the experiment, the optical-optical double resonance method is employed, utilizing the E3Σ1+(υ')←A3Π0+(53P1)(υ″=6)←X1Σ0+(υ=0) scheme. The excitation of a single isotopologue and the influence of the first-step excitation wavenumber on rotational level population distribution are carefully investigated, facilitating the simulation of the recorded rotational profiles. Spectra of several υ' ← υ″ = 6 vibrational components are measured. Their analysis resulted in the determination of Be', αe', and βe' rotational constants. In addition, the Re' bond length in the E3Σ1 in+ Rydberg-state inner well of 116Cd40Ar was determined. For comparison, LIF excitation spectra in multi-isotopologue excitation are discussed.

Individuals with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) may experience avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) symptoms. However, extant findings have been limited to specialist neurogastroenterology clinics. We assessed the association between DGBI and ARFID within the adult general population. A population-based Internet survey with pre-defined demographic quotas was conducted across the UK and USA in 2023. The survey included the Rome IV diagnostic questionnaire for DGBI, the Nine-Item ARFID Screen (NIAS), and questions regarding demographics, body mass index, non-gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, anxiety and depression, quality of life and healthcare use. 4002 adults (median age 46 [range 18-91] years, 50% female) completed the survey, of whom 1704 (42.6%) had symptoms compatible with at least one DGBI. The prevalence of ARFID-positive screens was significantly higher among participants with DGBI compared to those without DGBI (34.6% vs. 19.4%, adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.43-1.94), with similar findings noted in each country. Among participants with DGBI, positive ARFID screens by NIAS subscale were lack of interest in eating (21.5%), sensory-based avoidance (18.1%) and fear of aversive consequences (9.9%). The presence of ARFID increased with the number of DGBI anatomical regions, ranging from 19.4% in those with no DGBI, 27.7% with DGBI in one region, 39.5% for DGBI in two regions, 50.0% for DGBI in three regions, and 61.4% for DGBI in four regions (p<0.001). Individuals with DGBI plus ARFID, compared to those with DGBI alone, were significantly more likely to be underweight (7.9% vs. 1.5%), have greater non-gastrointestinal somatic symptoms and psychological distress, reduced mental and physical quality of life, and increased healthcare utilization. Positive ARFID screens are common in DGBI and associated with increased general health burden. Routine screening for ARFID in DGBI will inform the multi-integrated care plan provided by clinicians, dietitians, and psychologists.

Metastasis of a primary malignancy to the penis is rare with a limited number of reported cases this century. Of those cases, a small percentage are secondary to renal cell carcinoma, with most of these cases being caused by local invasion of prostate and bladder cancer. This report is that of a 70-year-old male who presented with penile swelling and pain, which was later determined to be secondary to metastatic renal cell carcinoma of the penis. Given the rarity of this disease process, the exact mechanism of invasion is still unknown and best treatment practices are based on symptomatic control.

The long-term clinical consequences of COVID-19 in cystic fibrosis (CF) remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to assess the incidence of long COVID in a large population of people with CF. This prospective, multicentre study enrolled individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between July 2021 and October 2022. Data collected included clinical features prior to infection, symptoms during the acute phase, hospitalization and symptom persistence after 1 and 6 months. Long COVID was defined according to CDC criteria as persistence of at least one COVID-related symptom for one or more months after diagnosis. The mean variation of FEV1 recorded 6 months after acute infection was also evaluated. A total of 1102 people with CF were recruited (median age: 18 years, 520 younger than 18). The infection was symptomatic in 90.1 % of cases. During the acute phase, 8 subjects required oxygen support; 31 were hospitalized, one patient required intensive care. Complications included one thromboembolic event and two episodes of myocarditis, but no patient died. Mean variation of FEV1 after 6 months from the infection was +1.8 % (95 % CI: 1.0-2.7). Long COVID was documented in 64 subjects (5.8 %, 95 % CI: 4.5-7.4) with a variety of symptoms which were still present in 12 cases 6 months after infection (1.1 %, 95 % CI: 0.6-1.9). In the omicron phase of the pandemic, COVID-19 was relatively mild and did not negatively impact pulmonary function after 6 months. Long COVID was observed at all ages, but extrapulmonary symptoms were more frequent and persistent in adults.

We evaluated the analytical performance of the TriVerity test system, a benchtop system for rapid measurement and interpretation of host messenger RNAs (mRNAs) measured quantitatively from PAXgene Blood RNA specimens using the TriVerity cartridge on the Myrna instrument. In approximately 30 minutes, 3 scores are generated from 29 host mRNAs for the likelihood of a bacterial infection, a viral infection, and illness severity (7-day need for ICU-level care), each falling into 1 of 5 interpretation bands (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high). Reproducibility, precision, limit of detection, linearity, interference, and sample and cartridge stability were determined per Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute standards. An operator survey assessed TriVerity's ease of use. Reproducibility demonstrated SDs meeting the acceptance criteria of <5.5 score units. The lowest concentration at which 100% of replicates showed measurable amplification was 1 × 106 cp/mL of in vitro RNA transcripts; the limit of quantification and detection were equivalent to blood containing 500 leukocytes/µL. Interference was not observed for 17 potential interferents. The cartridge was stable at room temperature (RT) for 9 and 12 months using accelerated testing at 37°C. TriVerity results were equivalent using fresh and frozen PAXgene Blood RNA samples. All operators agreed or strongly agreed that the TriVerity test system was easy to use. In summary, the analytical performance presented here, along with diagnostic accuracy established in the SEPSIS-SHIELD trial, demonstrates that the TriVerity system is reliable and user friendly, assisting clinicians in managing patients with suspected acute infections and sepsis in acute care settings. The prompt diagnosis of acute infections and sepsis is critical for better patient outcomes. We introduce a groundbreaking messenger RNA-based test, the first of its kind, designed to diagnose the presence of infection and predict illness severity in adult patients with suspected acute infections or sepsis. Several key findings regarding the accuracy and robustness of the test system are presented, which will be relevant to laboratories or acute care settings implementing the test for patient care. Furthermore, these findings may assist clinical researchers in developing analytical trial protocols aimed at the combined evaluation of RNA-based multi-marker tests with both diagnostic and prognostic test characteristics.

Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a common neurosurgical condition with a high recurrence rate following surgical evacuation. Middle meningeal artery embolization (MMAE) has emerged as an adjunctive or standalone treatment, but the optimal timing of embolization remains unclear. We evaluated whether early MMAE (≤2 days) versus delayed MMAE (3-7 days) is associated with improved clinical outcomes. In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we identified adult patients with cSDH who underwent MMAE using de-identified real-world patient data from the TriNetX platform. Patients were stratified into early versus delayed MMAE groups, defined relative to the date of surgery (surgical cohort) or diagnosis (non-surgical cohort). Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed based on demographics and comorbidities. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes included repeat surgical evacuation (for surgical cohort) and need for surgical evacuation (for non-surgical cohort) at 6-months. In the matched surgical cohort (n = 326), early MMAE was associated with a lower, but not statistically significant, rate of mortality compared to delayed MMAE (6.1 % vs. 11.0 %; OR, 0.527; 95 % CI, 0.235-1.178; P = 0.114). Similar rates were observed for repeat surgery for both groups. In the matched non-surgical cohort (n = 450), early MMAE was not associated with significant differences in mortality or need for surgery. Among patients with cSDH, early MMAE was associated with numerically lower rates of mortality in the surgical cohort. These findings support further investigation of early MMAE as a potential strategy to improve outcomes in surgical cSDH cases.

Pharmacological studies in vitro demonstrate the preventive and therapeutic potential of green tea and its constituent epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in the fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Previously reported correlations between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 morbidity/mortality suggest similar effects in vivo. Considering that some recent SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) sub-variants are less influenced by EGCG, this study aimed to determine whether this affects the aforementioned correlations, focusing on comparisons between the periods before (2021) and after (2022-2024) the emergence of the Omicron variant. Correlations between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 morbidity/mortality were calculated using multiple regression models accounting for several confounding factors in a subset (n=84) of countries/territories worldwide with Human Development Index (HDI) above 0.55. Higher per capita green tea consumption was associated with lower COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Statistically significant correlations were observed in 2021-2024. Compared with 2021, the strength of both correlations decreased; the relative decrease in the strength of the correlation between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 mortality was notably less pronounced. This differential decrease at the epidemiological level supports the idea that green tea consumption may have not only preventive but also therapeutic value regarding COVID-19. This aligns with in vitro pharmacological evidence indicating that green tea constituents target distinct molecular pathways responsible for the entry of the virus and its replication. While promising, these findings require further assessment in observational and interventional studies focused on potential therapeutic benefits.

To estimate the prevalence of various hemoglobinopathies among newborns, women in antenatal clinic and children presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of sickle cell disease (SCD). A hospital-based prospective study was conducted at a Centre of Excellence for SCD (COESCD). Dried blood spot (DBS) samples were collected for newborn screening using heel-prick and venous samples were used in the post-neonatal age group. Hemoglobin variant analysis was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Out of 26,642 neonates screened, 1.87% (n = 498) were found to have abnormal hemoglobin patterns. The prevalence of hemoglobin variants detected among women screened during antenatal check-up and children with signs and symptoms of SCD were found to be 6.11% and 22.69%, respectively. Intensive screening programs have led to detection of a large number of cases with hemoglobinopathies including rare hemoglobin variants.

Automatic segmentation of retinal vessels from retinography images is crucial for timely clinical diagnosis. However, the high cost and specialized expertise required for annotating medical images often result in limited labeled datasets, which constrains the full potential of deep learning methods. Recent advances in self-supervised pretraining using unlabeled data have shown significant benefits for downstream tasks. Recognizing that multimodal feature fusion can substantially enhance retinal vessel segmentation accuracy, this paper introduces a novel self-supervised pretraining framework that leverages pairs of unlabeled multimodal fundus images to generate supervisory signals. The core idea is to exploit the complementary differences between the two modalities to construct a multimodal feature fusion map containing vessel information, achieved through Vision Transformer encoding and correlation filtering. Instance-level discriminative features are then learned under the guidance of INFOMAX loss, and the learned knowledge is transferred to a supervised vessel segmentation network. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results among unsupervised methods and remains competitive with supervised baselines while greatly reducing annotation requirements.

Dental caries is one of the most common preventable diseases among Indigenous children. The study aimed to estimate the efficacy of an Early Childhood Caries (ECC) intervention among Aboriginal Australian children over 9 years, and to explore potential risk factors associated with dental caries among Indigenous Australian children. Data were from a randomized controlled trial conducted in South Australia, Australia. Four hundred and forty-eight women pregnant with an Aboriginal child were randomly allocated to either an immediate (II) or delayed (DI) intervention group between January 2011 and May 2012. The immediate intervention comprised (1) provision of dental care to mothers during pregnancy; (2) application of fluoride varnish to teeth of children at ages 6, 12; and 18 months; (3) motivational interviewing delivered in conjunction with; and (4) anticipatory guidance. Mothers/children in the DI group received the same intervention commencing at child aged 2 years. Follow-ups occurred when children were aged 2-, 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-years. In this analysis, outcomes were severity of caries experience: mean dmft/DMFT at child aged 9 years. Dependent variables included mothers' baseline and seven years follow-up characteristics (age, education level, source of income, residential location, smoking and alcohol status) and children's birth and feeding, and dental behaviours characteristics (sex, gestation, birth weight, breastfeeding status and sweet food consumption, and frequency of tooth brushing). Multivariable log-Poisson regression models with robust standard error estimation were applied as a statistical model to estimate multivariable relationships of dental caries and other covariates. Risk ratios (RRs) with their 95%CI were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by using the inverse-probability-of censoring weighting (IPCW) to overcome the loss-follow-up issues. Data were available for 367 (II = 180 and DI = 187) children at age 9 years. The mean dmft was 3.41 (95% CI: 2.95-3.87) and DMFT was 0.31(95%CI: 0.22-0.41). In multivariable modelling, mean dmft was higher (RR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.01-1.26) among DI children than II children, but there were no significant differences in the permanent dentition. Risk factors for caries severity in both the primary and permanent dentition included lower mothers' education level (<12 years level: dmft; RR = 1.56, 95% CI:1.31-1.86; and 'Trade or TAFT: DMFT: RR =3.40, 95%CI: 1.16-9.98). Other risk factors for dental caries experience in the primary dentition included preterm birth, low birth weight, child not breastfed and sugar consumption more than 10%, and in permanent dentition was self-rated 'fair/poor' or 'Good' children's oral health, compared with self-rated 'Excellent/very good' oral health. The present study suggests that, within this cohort, initiating an early childhood caries intervention during pregnancy and infancy may be associated with lower caries experience in the primary dentition by age 9 years compared to a later start. Low maternal education level was associated with caries severity in both primary and permanent dentitions. Sugar consumption, a modifiable risk factor, greater than 10% was an important contributor to dental caries in primary teeth.

"To evaluate the clinical efficacy of ""Shibao Decoction"" in the management of late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) caused by deficiency of kidney essence. Sixty male patients with late-onset hypogonadism of kidney essence deficiency type were randomly assigned to the treatment group and the control group, each with 30 cases. The patients in treatment group were treated with oral Shibao Decoction, while the control group was treated with oral Testosterone Undecanoate Capsules. The patients in both groups were treated for 12 weeks. The PADAM symptom score, TCM syndrome score, serum total testosterone (TT), serum free testosterone (FT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), body mass index (BMI), total skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), FBG, FINS, and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) levels were compared between the two groups. After treatment, PADAM scores for each item and TCM symptoms score decreased, TT and FT increased in both groups, all with statistically significant differences from those of pre-treatment (P<0.05). The level of SHBG in the control group decreased (P<0.05), which had not changed significantly in the treatment group (P>0.05). After treatment, SMI and ASMI increased in both groups significantly (P<0.05). BMI decreased in the control group (P<0.05), which had not changed significantly in the treatment group (P>0.05). The level of FINS decreased in the control group (P<0.05), which had not changed significantly in the treatment group (P>0.05). FPG had not changed significantly in both groups (P>0.05), and the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) had significantly improved in both groups, all with statistically significant differences from those of pre-treatment (P<0.05). After treatment, the total effective rates of PADAM score and TCM syndrome score in the treatment group were 73.3% and 86.6% respectively, and the total effective rates in the control group were 66.7% and 76.6% respectively. The total effective rates of the two scores in the treatment group were slightly higher than those in the control group (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the indicators between the two groups after treatment, and the treatment group is generally comparable with the control group in the therapeutic effects (P>0.05). And no adverse reactions occurred during treatment in both groups. The ""Shibao Decoction"" has a remarkable therapeutic effect on late-onset hypogonadism caused by deficiency of kidney essence and has good safety. It can be used as an alternative to testosterone undecanoate and is worthy of clinical promotion and application."

Previous studies primarily analyzed spinal cord injuries in patients with metastatic spinal tumors after such injuries had already occurred. This study aimed to determine whether clinical and radiological factors are associated with the occurrence and severity of newly developed spinal cord injuries within 1 year in patients with metastatic spinal tumors. We retrospectively examined patients with metastatic spinal tumors who were referred to the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine between 2017 and 2021. Using patients' clinical data and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, we investigated whether pain characteristics, Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS), and Epidural Spinal Cord Compression (ESCC) grades were associated with the occurrence and severity of spinal cord injuries within 1 year of MRI evaluation. Among the 70 included patients, 40 developed spinal cord injuries. Multivariate analysis identified an ESCC grade 2 or 3 (high-grade ESCC) as the only significant predictor of spinal cord injury within 1 year (P = 0.016). Higher ESCC grades were also significantly associated with a shorter time to onset of spinal cord injuries (P = 0.003). Regarding the severity of spinal cord injuries, the total score and categories of SINS were significantly higher in the mild deficit group than in the moderate to severe deficit group (P = 0.024 and P = 0.049, respectively). In patients with metastatic spinal tumors, high-grade ESCC was a significant predictor of spinal cord injury within 1 year and was associated with an earlier onset of spinal cord injury. Radicular pain and unstable spines based on SINS categories were also strongly associated with the occurrence of spinal cord injury. This study provides valuable insights for predicting 1-year functional outcomes and determining management strategies for spinal metastases.

"This study aimed to delineate global research trends in immunogenic cell death (ICD) within hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by mapping collaborative networks, thematic shifts, and high-impact findings. Using VOSviewer network visualisation and R-bibliometrix quantitative metrics, we sought to show how scientific output has evolved and to pinpoint research gaps that may guide future investigations. We retrieved 568 publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (2000-2024) using a tailored keyword strategy encompassing ""Hepatocellular carcinoma"" and ""Immunogenic cell death."" Data were analyzed with VOSviewer and R-bibliometrix to visualize co-authorship patterns, keyword clusters, institutional collaborations, and citation metrics. Annual publication volumes rose markedly, peaking at 68 in 2023, and this quantitative surge parallels a qualitative shift toward clinically actionable research outputs. Over the entire period, the corpus accumulated 13 161 citations (mean 23.2 citations/article), indicating strong and growing academic influence. Keyword co-occurrence revealed three main clusters highlighting immunotherapeutic mechanisms, molecular pathways (e.g., HMGB1 and calreticulin), and epidemiological concerns. China and the United States led in overall output, with universities such as the University of California System, Harvard University, and Shanghai-based institutions forming robust collaborative networks. Highly cited articles, such as Zhong et al. (2016, Cell) on autophagy-inflammation crosstalk and Yu et al. (2020, ACS Nano) on mitophagy-augmented doxorubicin, underscored the role of autophagy, checkpoint inhibitors, and combination therapies in harnessing ICD to overcome HCC's immunosuppressive microenvironment. These patterns indicate that the field is transitioning from descriptive bibliometrics to translational studies, signalling that forthcoming work will likely accelerate rational design of ICD-based clinical trials and inform funding priorities. The findings confirm ICD as an emerging cornerstone of HCC research, with demonstrated capacity to reshape clinical-trial portfolios and refine biomarker-driven patient stratification, reflecting both deeper mechanistic insights and accelerating translational efforts. Ongoing challenges include refining biomarkers, integrating ICD inducers with immunotherapies, and accounting for HCC's inherent complexities such as chronic liver disease and metabolic dysfunction. Future research directions focus on the use of nanotechnology for precise drug delivery, the integration of metabolomics and genomics data to enable personalised treatment, and the improvement of combination therapies combined with local interventions."

Non-invasive criteria have been proposed for initiating treatment; however, these have not been validated in clinical practice. We validated the proposed criteria and established new guidelines for initiating resmetirom treatment in clinical practice. Cross-sectional study of 1281 MASLD patients from the HEPAmet registry with biopsy, comorbidity assessment, analytical profile, and elastography. Identification of MASLD with fibrosis stage 2-3 was the main endpoint. A comprehensive review of international guidelines and expert consensus up to November 2024, focusing on therapeutic indications, was conducted. Thirty-eight percent of patients(486/1281) were diagnosed with MASLD fibrosis stages 2-3 based on biopsy. However, only 39% and 56% of them met treatment eligibility criteria according to the Expert Panel Criteria and the AASLD Practice Guidance, respectively. They included 45% of patients with early-stage fibrosis. False-positive and false-negative rates ranged from 23% to 41% and 44% to 60%, respectively, with AUROC values below 0.60.These findings were validated in an external cohort. A two-step strategy, first selecting patients with FIB-4>1.30, or with diabetes and overweight if FIB-4<1.30, followed by a liver stiffness between 8-25 kPa, demonstrated higher positive(55%) and negative predictive values(77%), and AUROC(0.67).This approach successfully identified 74% of the target population. The diagnostic performance and reliability of the proposed non-invasive criteria for initiating resmetirom treatment were suboptimal.About the half of patients with indication would not receive treatment under these criteria.A new strategy, using FIB-4, the presence of diabetes and overweight, and liver stiffness improved the identification of MASLD patients with fibrosis stage 2-3.
