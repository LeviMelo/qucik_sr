"This study aimed to delineate global research trends in immunogenic cell death (ICD) within hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by mapping collaborative networks, thematic shifts, and high-impact findings. Using VOSviewer network visualisation and R-bibliometrix quantitative metrics, we sought to show how scientific output has evolved and to pinpoint research gaps that may guide future investigations. We retrieved 568 publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (2000-2024) using a tailored keyword strategy encompassing ""Hepatocellular carcinoma"" and ""Immunogenic cell death."" Data were analyzed with VOSviewer and R-bibliometrix to visualize co-authorship patterns, keyword clusters, institutional collaborations, and citation metrics. Annual publication volumes rose markedly, peaking at 68 in 2023, and this quantitative surge parallels a qualitative shift toward clinically actionable research outputs. Over the entire period, the corpus accumulated 13 161 citations (mean 23.2 citations/article), indicating strong and growing academic influence. Keyword co-occurrence revealed three main clusters highlighting immunotherapeutic mechanisms, molecular pathways (e.g., HMGB1 and calreticulin), and epidemiological concerns. China and the United States led in overall output, with universities such as the University of California System, Harvard University, and Shanghai-based institutions forming robust collaborative networks. Highly cited articles, such as Zhong et al. (2016, Cell) on autophagy-inflammation crosstalk and Yu et al. (2020, ACS Nano) on mitophagy-augmented doxorubicin, underscored the role of autophagy, checkpoint inhibitors, and combination therapies in harnessing ICD to overcome HCC's immunosuppressive microenvironment. These patterns indicate that the field is transitioning from descriptive bibliometrics to translational studies, signalling that forthcoming work will likely accelerate rational design of ICD-based clinical trials and inform funding priorities. The findings confirm ICD as an emerging cornerstone of HCC research, with demonstrated capacity to reshape clinical-trial portfolios and refine biomarker-driven patient stratification, reflecting both deeper mechanistic insights and accelerating translational efforts. Ongoing challenges include refining biomarkers, integrating ICD inducers with immunotherapies, and accounting for HCC's inherent complexities such as chronic liver disease and metabolic dysfunction. Future research directions focus on the use of nanotechnology for precise drug delivery, the integration of metabolomics and genomics data to enable personalised treatment, and the improvement of combination therapies combined with local interventions."

Exercise and manual therapy are recommended for managing non-specific neck pain (NSNP), but most randomised controlled trials (RCT) have not identified specific subgroups that might respond best to each intervention. Although matched exercise was found to be superior to unmatched interventions in the short term, high heterogeneity in effectiveness estimates and variable levels of intervention fidelity and quality of delivery may contribute to inconsistent findings on the effectiveness of matched or stratified care. To assess the quality of intervention reporting and its relationship to treatment effect estimates in RCTs comparing matched versus unmatched exercise or manual therapy interventions for NSNP. Secondary analysis of a systematic review with meta-analysis. For all included RCTs, independent reviewers rated the quality of intervention reporting using the TIDieR checklist. Meta-regression was used to assess the direction and magnitude of association between TIDieR scores and treatment effect estimates (standardised mean difference of change scores) for short-term pain and disability outcomes. The items related to intervention fidelity were not adequately reported. Materials used, intervention provider, location and modification were inconsistently reported. Poorer quality of intervention reporting was associated with larger treatment effect estimates in short-term pain and disability in favour of matched interventions. Trials with inadequate intervention reporting may overestimate the benefits of matched exercise or manual therapy treatments for NSNP. The lack of SUFFICIENT information to judge intervention fidelity in this field reinforces the need for better guidance on this specific aspect of study design, conduct, and reporting.

The difficulty in providing optimal treatment has been related to patients' fear of the discomfort that comes with anesthetic needle insertion. The main purpose of this study is to clinically assess the effect of needle bevel on patient's perception of pain during inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) anesthesia and evaluate the needle tip for mechanical deformation. Sixty-six children 5-7 years old, who were indicated for IANB anesthesia, were selected from the outpatient clinic of Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups according to the type of needle bevel used. Group I (n = 33) received INAB anesthesia using double scalpel blade bevel needle, while group II (n = 33) received the injection using conventional bevel needle. Pain reaction was evaluated subjectively using modified Maunuksela face pain scale (FPS) and objectively using Sensory, Eye, and Motor (SEM) scale. After the respective injections, the needles were prepared for microscopic examination. The FPS and SEM showed significantly lower pain scores during IANB anesthesia with double scalpel blade bevel needle compared to the conventional bevel needle (p = 0.002, p = 0.003 respectively). No significant difference in mechanical angle deformation between the two needles was observed (p = 0.837). For IANB anesthesia, double scalpel blade bevel needle demonstrated significantly less injection pain. All dentalneedles demonstrated tip deformation after single use.

Ayurveda recommends a comprehensive therapeutic approach for osteoarthritis management. However, most of the published clinical studies on Ayurveda interventions for osteoarthritis management have addressed selected modalities of Ayurveda treatment rather than the holistic therapeutic regimen. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a multimodal Ayurveda treatment protocol in the long-term management of primary osteoarthritis of the knee compared with standard care. The proposed open-label, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted in individuals of any gender aged 40 to 70 years and diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis of the knee as per the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Individuals with grade 4 radiographic changes in the affected knee (based on the Kellgren-Lawrence classification) and with comorbidities were not considered. The study was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. A total of 150 participants underwent random assignment in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the Ayurveda treatment protocol or conventional standard care for 180 days. The primary outcome was the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score from baseline. The secondary outcome measures included the change in the score for pain, stiffness, and physical function from baseline; change in the range of motion of the knee joint; change in the score of the numeric pain rating scale, Pain Disability Index, and 12-item short-form survey questionnaire (to assess health-related quality of life); change in highly sensitive C-reactive protein levels, interleukin-6 levels, magnetic resonance imaging scan findings, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan findings; and change in the need for rescue analgesic medication from baseline. Safety was evaluated by recording the incidence of adverse events and changes in liver and kidney function tests from baseline. Recruitment of study participants commenced on October 11, 2022. Currently, all the participants completed the study and the analysis of the study outcomes is ongoing. This randomized controlled trial will be the first study to explore the potential benefits of a multimodal Ayurveda regimen (based on Ayurveda principles and scientific evidence) in the long-term management of osteoarthritis of the knee through validated subjective, laboratory, and imaging parameters. The outcomes of this study may address the needs and challenges associated with osteoarthritis management.

The antioxidant capacity and mechanism of linusorbs (LOs) on lipid systems with different unsaturation was unclear. This study aimed to explore the oxidative stability of flaxseed oil (FO), walnut oil (WO), and camellia oil (CO) in the presence of LOs in order to recognize the impacts of unsaturation degree of the lipid systems on the performance of natural antioxidants. By the evaluation of fatty acid compositions, PV/CD and AV/p-AV value, and changes of characteristic peaks in Raman spectra, LOs can inhibit oil oxidation in different lipid systems, especially potent for C18:3-based FO, followed by C18:2-based WO, and C18:1-based CO. The inhibitory mechanism was indicated that LOs sacrifice themselves to terminate lipid peroxide and free radical, and the different inhibitory efficacy might be due to the different participation degree of LOs in the main chain reaction and side chain initiation of lipids oxidation principle.

Non-invasive criteria have been proposed for initiating treatment; however, these have not been validated in clinical practice. We validated the proposed criteria and established new guidelines for initiating resmetirom treatment in clinical practice. Cross-sectional study of 1281 MASLD patients from the HEPAmet registry with biopsy, comorbidity assessment, analytical profile, and elastography. Identification of MASLD with fibrosis stage 2-3 was the main endpoint. A comprehensive review of international guidelines and expert consensus up to November 2024, focusing on therapeutic indications, was conducted. Thirty-eight percent of patients(486/1281) were diagnosed with MASLD fibrosis stages 2-3 based on biopsy. However, only 39% and 56% of them met treatment eligibility criteria according to the Expert Panel Criteria and the AASLD Practice Guidance, respectively. They included 45% of patients with early-stage fibrosis. False-positive and false-negative rates ranged from 23% to 41% and 44% to 60%, respectively, with AUROC values below 0.60.These findings were validated in an external cohort. A two-step strategy, first selecting patients with FIB-4>1.30, or with diabetes and overweight if FIB-4<1.30, followed by a liver stiffness between 8-25 kPa, demonstrated higher positive(55%) and negative predictive values(77%), and AUROC(0.67).This approach successfully identified 74% of the target population. The diagnostic performance and reliability of the proposed non-invasive criteria for initiating resmetirom treatment were suboptimal.About the half of patients with indication would not receive treatment under these criteria.A new strategy, using FIB-4, the presence of diabetes and overweight, and liver stiffness improved the identification of MASLD patients with fibrosis stage 2-3.

Tissue homeostasis is dependent on precise coordination between endocrine organs in response to changes in organism physiology. Secreted circulating factors from adipocytes (called adipokines) regulate the behavior of stem cell lineages in peripheral tissues in multiple organisms. In addition to their endocrine roles, Drosophila adipocytes store and secrete amino acid storage proteins throughout development. During the larval feeding period, adipocytes secrete storage proteins into the hemolymph, which are reabsorbed by the adipose tissue during metamorphosis to control adult organ size and fertility. Despite the known functions for storage proteins during the larval stages, their requirement during Drosophila adulthood and reproduction are uncharacterized. We discover that adipocyte-specific knockdown of the storage proteins Larval serum protein 1 ( Lsp1 ) α/β/γ and Larval serum protein 2 ( Lsp2 ) results in a decrease in GSC maintenance. We further reveal that decreased GSC number is due to downregulation of Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling in GSCs, suggesting compromised amino acid sensing directly in GSCs. We also find that the proteins that mediate storage protein adipocyte reabsorption, Fat body protein 1 (Fbp1) and Fat body protein 2 (Fbp2), are expressed in ovarian follicle cells. Intriguingly, Fbp1 nor Fbp2 appear to be required in follicle cells for GSC maintenance, suggesting undiscovered requirements for amino acid storage proteins in oogenesis. Our results highlight a novel role for Drosophila amino acid storage proteins during adulthood and in regulating tissue stem cell lineages.

Statin adherence impacts cardiovascular outcomes, yet disparities persist. Understanding sociodemographic factors and barriers is crucial for targeted interventions. To investigate the relationship between sociodemographic factors and statin adherence across racial and ethnic groups. This retrospective study examined sociodemographic factors, prescription records, clinical factors, and responses from the Demographic, Drug Exposure, Healthcare Utilization Survey (HUS) in the All of Us (AoU) cohort. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed the impact of sociodemographic factors on adherence stratified by race. Adult participants with statin prescription records. Subgroup analyses included those who responded to the HUS. Statin prescription. Percent days covered (PDC), calculated as the proportion of days within a year in which a person prescribed a statin filled a prescription. Adequate adherence was defined as PDC ≥ 80%. Of the 17,029 participants with a statin prescription, the mean statin PDC was 57%, with 66% reporting a PDC ≤ 80%. Racial and ethnic differences in adherence were observed, with Non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants having a median PDC of 74% (IQR [0.25,0.98]), Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) 49% (IQR [0.25,0.98]), and Hispanic participants 25% (IQR [0.08,0.49]). NHW participants faced employment barriers (OR 0.63, 95% CI [0.46, 0.86]) and provider inaccessibility (OR 0.56, 95% CI [0.40, 0.76]) as significant factors for lower adherence. NHB participants experienced patient anxiety (OR 0.53, 95% CI [0.30, 0.90]) and financial barriers (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.50, 0.85]), while Hispanic participants showed patient anxiety (OR 0.14, 95% CI [0.02, 0.60]) and immigrant status (OR 0.36, 95% CI [0.17, 0.76]) as significant factors for lower adherence. To address cardiovascular disease disparities, it is crucial to recognize unique sociodemographic barriers to statin adherence within racial and ethnic groups. Our findings highlight the need for tailored strategies considering the diverse barriers each group faces. Targeted interventions can bridge adherence gaps and improve cardiovascular outcomes across populations. This approach recognizes that while race and ethnicity may correlate with specific barriers, it is the underlying SDoH that often play a pivotal role in statin adherence. Question: What are predictors and barriers to statin adherence in the All of Us cohort?Findings: Among 17,029 statin users, 57% reported low statin adherence, which varied by racial and ethnic groups and was associated with social determinants of health (SDoH). For Non-Hispanic Whites, employment barriers and provider inaccessibility were linked to lower adherence. Non-Hispanic Blacks faced patient anxiety and financial barriers, while Hispanics' adherence was impacted by immigrant status, healthcare coverage and patient anxiety.Conclusions: Unique SDoH influence statin adherence among diverse populations. Tailored interventions addressing specific barriers are needed to improve adherence and reduce cardiovascular disease risk equitably and effectively.

Remimazolam besylate, despite being widely used in various clinical settings, lacks evidence in cardiac anesthesia. This trial compared its efficacy with propofol in elective cardiac surgery. A total of 320 adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery via cardiopulmonary bypass between December 2024 and March 2025 were randomized 1:1 to either propofol (1 mg/kg for induction and 1-1.5 mg/kg/h for maintenance) or remimazolam besylate (0.3 mg/kg for induction and 1 mg/kg/h for maintenance) groups. The primary outcome was the sedation success rate (ie, bispectral index 40-60 throughout surgery with predefined dosages and without rescue sedatives), with an absolute difference of 3% as a noninferiority margin. Secondary outcomes included time from drug administration to bispectral index <60 (minute) and bispectral index variation within 15 minutes after drug withdrawal. Application of vasoactive drugs during induction, time to extubation (hour), length of stay in intensive care unit (hour), and hospital (day) were recorded. Of 320 enrolled patients, all patients completed the trial and 318 patients were analyzed eventually. The sedation success rate of the whole surgery was significantly higher in the remimazolam besylate group (159; 99.4%) than in the propofol group (130; 82.3%) (absolute difference 17.1%, 95% confidence interval 11.6%-23.9%; P < .001). No significant differences in time from drug administration to bispectral index <60 (P = .119), bispectral index variation after drug withdrawal (P = .658), time to extubation (P = .824), and length of stay in intensive care unit (P = .898) and hospital (P = .294) were observed. Remimazolam besylate is noninferior to propofol in terms of sedation efficacy during elective cardiac procedures.

Minimal exposure to neurosurgery in standard medical school curricula alongside a growing need for neurosurgical care necessitate early exposure programs that promote medical student retention in neurosurgery. Here, we evaluate preclinical students' perceptions on a one-day, resident-designed introductory neurosurgical course. Course curriculum involved hands-on and discussion-based elements split into three stations: (1) suturing/general information; (2) introduction to drilling/LPs/EVDs; and (3) case/clinical skills review. Anonymous online post-course surveys were administered immediately after the course and one year after the course following completion of clerkships. Ten medical students participated in the course, 70 % of which indicated desire to pursue neurosurgery at course onset. Nine students responded to an immediate post-survey, which revealed that, in students with a desire to pursue neurosurgery (n = 6) versus those undifferentiated in specialty interest (n = 3): the program was rated as having high versus moderate impacts on readiness and enthusiasm for surgical clerkships (readiness: avg 4 vs 3.67; enthusiasm: avg 4.3 vs 3.67), on fostering a sense of belonging within neurosurgery (avg 4.67 vs 3.33), and on clarifying specialty interests (avg 4.3 vs 3.3). At 1-year, 75 % of participants (n = 6), including 100 % of students (n = 4) from minority backgrounds, noted a persistent desire to pursue neurosurgery. In participants with a continued interest in neurosurgery versus those planning to pursue different fields, the course was rated as having high versus moderate impacts on preparedness for surgery clerkship experiences (average 4.17 vs 3.5) and moderate impact on participant desire to pursue neurosurgery (3.67 vs 3). Significant enthusiasm and sense of belonging fostered by the course, particularly amongst students with prior interests in neurosurgery, support that early specialty-specific exposure may promote retention of students in neurosurgery. High rates of persistent engagement in neurosurgery amongst minority students at 1-year post-course suggest that such courses may help to build a more representative neurosurgical workforce.

Type-2-diabetes-mellitus (T2DM) impairs outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-with-defibrillator (CRTd).While both sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have cardiovascular benefits, their combination impact in CRTd-treated T2DM patients remains unclear. In this prospective multicenter observational study, 2,257 T2DM patients treated with CRTd were stratified into three groups: SGLT2i monotherapy (n 874), GLP-1RAs monotherapy (n 808), and combination therapy with GLP-1RAs/SGLT2i (n 575). Primary endpoints were CRT-response and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations at 1-year follow-up. Secondary endpoints included changes in glycemic control, renal function, inflammatory/oxidative markers, and cardiac deaths. At 1 year, the combination therapy group had significantly higher CRT-response rate (66.3 %) compared to SGLT2i (59.6 %) and GLP-1RAs (59.2 %) groups (p = 0.014), and lower HF-hospitalization rates (15.7 % vs. 23.5 % and 24.4 %, respectively; p = 0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed combination therapy as an independent predictor of CRT response (HR 1.659, CI 95 % [1.320-2.085]; p 0.001) and reduced HF hospitalizations (0.822, CI 95 % [0.751-0.966]; p0.012) at 1 year of follow-up. In T2DM patients receiving CRTd, combination therapy with GLP-1RAs/SGLT2i was associated with improvements in cardiac function and clinical outcomes compared to monotherapy. GLP-1RAs/SGLT2i could optimize CRT responsiveness and reduce HF-hospitalizations in T2DM patients.

To evaluate the quality of care provided to patients with febrile neutropenia (FN) hospitalized at the Depart-ment of Infectious Diseases, Military University Hospital Prague, as a foundation for improving the management of this condition. A retrospective observational analysis of patients diagnosed with the ICD-10 code D70 from 1 January 2015 to 1 June 2023. All evaluated parameters were selected primarily to facilitate the assessment of care quality and compliance with recommended practices. Of 32 evaluated patients, 19 met the criteria for FN. A history of conditions or treatments predisposing to neutropenia was noted in 74 % of patients. Seventy-four percent were admitted following evaluation or referral from an emergency department or another specialist. Blood cultures (at least two sets) were initially obtained in 80 % of cases. Antibiotics were initially administered correctly to all patients. However, considering antibiotic combinations would have been appropriate in 40 % of cases. No patients received antibiotics within one hour of initial contact with a healthcare facility. Antifungals were therapeutically administered to 58% of patients, though 37 % of these had no clear indication. A hematologist was consulted in 75 % of cases, and a stimulating factor (filgrastim) was administered in 88 % of cases. All patients were treated in isolation. An infection source was identified in 74 % of cases. The analysis highlighted areas for improving the quality of care for patients with FN. Based on this study, an internal procedure is now being developed that will focus on coordination with emergency and other departments, emphasize obtaining blood cultures, and ensure the timely and correct administration of antibiotics, including their possible combinations, as well as antifungals.

Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCDLBCL-LT), is an uncommon and aggressive subtype of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, typically affecting elderly women and predominantly involving the lower extremities. Its diagnosis relies on immunohistochemical profiling and clinical presentation. We report a rare case of a 45-year-old male presenting initially with scalp and supraciliary plaques. The early diagnosis suggested tumor-stage mycosis fungoides, based on histopathology and immunophenotype (CD4+, CD20-). However, over time, the patient developed disseminated nodular lesions, with new biopsies revealing CD20+, MUM1+, BCL2+, Ki-67 70%, and MYC expression, consistent with PCDLBCL-LT. Despite multiple lines of systemic therapy, including R-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone combined with rituximab), methotrexate, gemcitabine, platinum-based chemotherapy, and autologous stem cell transplant, the disease progressed, ultimately leading to the patient's death. This case highlights an atypical clinical presentation of PCDLBCL-LT in a young male, initially mimicking T-cell lymphoma. The diagnostic evolution underscores the importance of repeated biopsies and immunohistochemical reevaluation in persistent or atypical cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders. It also raises awareness of CD20-negative variants and potential coexistence with T-cell lymphomas such as mycosis fungoides.

Age is a major risk factor for a range of diseases including prostate cancer. Understanding how age influences the susceptibility of normal prostate epithelial cells to cancer initiation is complicated by the fact that aging affects all tissues in the body. Assessing how various aging mechanisms influence the prostate epithelium is a necessary step to determine the critical factors associated with aging that increase prostate cancer risk. Here, we take a broad view of both prostate epithelial cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that change with age and are likely to contribute to age-related risk of prostate tumorigenesis. For each factor, we discuss the impact of these age-related changes on cancer risk. We highlight important areas where additional research is required to help decipher the specific age-associated changes that contribute to prostate cancer initiation. Finally, we address the potential impact of various therapeutic interventions on aging phenotypes and cancer risk.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the survival outcomes of dental implants placed in the pterygoid region and assess the potential influence of multiple clinical variables on their survival. A retrospective chart review was conducted on pterygoid implants placed over a 9-year period at the University of Connecticut Department of Prosthodontics. All pterygoid implants were placed by a single board-certified prosthodontist following a standardized surgical protocol. The implants were restored by various clinicians during the 9-year period. Data collected included implant size and type, loading protocol, surgical and prosthetic complications, patient gender, presence of parafunctional habits, and type of opposing dentition. A life table was used to calculate interval survival rates (ISR) and cumulative survival rates (CSR) of pterygoid implants. A total of 102 pterygoid implants placed in 69 patients (32 males, 37 females) were eligible for this retrospective study. The mean follow-up time was 34.35 months. A total of five implant failures were observed, resulting in a cumulative survival rate of 94.74%. All implant failures occurred within the first 4 to 5 months following implant placement and prior to any functional loading, suggesting a failure to achieve osseointegration. No intraoperative complications were noted, and only one postoperative surgical complication was observed, which was successfully managed without further issue. Roughened surface implants placed in the pterygoid region offer favorable implant survival of 95% with minimal complications.

Plasma metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables detection of microbial cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (mcfDNA) in blood without the need for culture or organism-specific primers. Here, we review clinical performance, methodological variability, and real-world application of plasma mNGS for infectious disease diagnosis in immunocompromised hosts (ICHs). Plasma mNGS has rapidly gained attention as a novel diagnostic tool for infections in ICHs, offering broad-range pathogen detection from a noninvasive blood sample. A growing number of observational studies have assessed its diagnostic yield, clinical impact, and potential to reduce invasive procedures or time to diagnosis. However, results remain variable, with significant differences in study design, patient populations, and adjudication methods. While some studies report meaningful added value, others highlight challenges related to clinical interpretation, limited standardization, and uncertain cost-effectiveness. Moreover, although mNGS offers a wide organismal scope, its sensitivity is influenced by pathogen type, immune status, and technical limitations - particularly in fungal infections and low-burden diseases. Overall, mNGS has yet to find a clearly defined role in routine diagnostic workflows. Understanding the current evidence, limitations, and variability surrounding plasma mNGS is essential to guide its appropriate clinical use and to inform future integration into diagnostic pathways for ICHs.

To establish and validate a nomogram model for the quality of sleep in patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and to evaluate its performance. From January 2023 to June 2023, 484 RIF patients who underwent ART fertilization treatment at the Reproductive Medicine Center of Tongji University-affiliated Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital were selected as the modeling set and internal validation. Additionally, from July to September 2023, 223 RIF patients who underwent ART fertilization treatment at the Reproductive Medicine Center of Tongji University-affiliated Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital were chosen as the external validation set. Their clinical data was collected. Lasso regression was used to screen potential predictive variables and multifactor logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the final predictors. A nomogram model was established, and the model was evaluated using methods such as plotting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test, and decision curve analysis. Through Lasso regression and multifactor logistic regression, 7 predictors were identified, including FSH, E2, depression mood (moderate, severe), daily exercise time, sun exposure, caffeine intake, and shift work (>16h/w) for constructing the nomogram model. The AUC for the modeling set was 0.971 (95%CI:0.952∼0.989), for the internal validation set was 0.960 (95%CI:0.937∼0.979), and for the external validation set was 0.850 (95%CI:0.739∼0.960), indicating good predictive performance of the model. This study established and validated a nomogram model composed of 7 clinical indicators for sleep disorders in RIF patients. The predictors include both physiological indicators and daily lifestyle habits, demonstrating significant predictive value and clinical application efficiency. It can be used for early identification of potential sleep disorders in RIF patients, providing certain reference significance for clinical work.

Gabapentin (GBP), an anticonvulsant approved for seizures and neuropathic pain, is frequently co-prescribed with buprenorphine (BUP), a partial mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, to manage withdrawal and pain in individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). While GBP is generally considered safe, emerging evidence suggests abuse potential when combined with opioids. This study used the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm to assess the rewarding effects of GBP alone and in combination with BUP. Male mice underwent standard CPP procedures. Treatment groups included GBP (100 or 300mg/kg) alone or combined with BUP (1.0mg/kg). Naltrexone (NAL; 10.0mg/kg), an opioid receptor antagonist, was co-administered with each treatment to assess MOR involvement. Drugs and saline were alternated over eight consecutive days. GBP induced significant CPP at both doses, but only the 100mg/kg effect was prevented by NAL. BUP-induced CPP was prevented by NAL. Co-administration of GBP and BUP at either dose produced a CPP, which persisted despite NAL treatment. Both opioid and non-opioid systems may contribute to the rewarding effects of GBP and GBP-BUP combinations. These findings raise important concerns about the abuse potential of GBP, particularly when co-prescribed with BUP, and underscore the need for cautious clinical use and further investigation into non-opioid mechanisms of reward.

We read with great interest the article by House et al. detailing recruitment strategies for the Fast Track to Health trial, which evaluated intermittent versus continuous energy restriction in adolescents with obesity and cardiometabolic complications [1]. The study provides valuable insight into recruitment yields across varied referral sources, highlighting the dominant role of specialist referrals (21.2 % enrolment yield) in successful engagement. While the authors have underscored the utility of specialist engagement, the findings also expose a structural gap: underutilisation of primary care and community-based channels.

Young-onset type 2 diabetes (YOD), diagnosed before 40 years of age, entails a high disease burden and potential for early dependence on disability benefits. The risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) varies with socio-economic status and ethnic background, yet the relationship between these factors and age at diagnosis is insufficiently explored. We aimed to study associations between YOD and living on disability benefits, educational level and country background. Cross-sectional data on 8640 individuals with T2D, linked to data on educational level and country background, were compared with population data from the same residential areas. Similar comparisons were made for data on disability benefits among 3854 individuals of working age (<65 years). Using negative binomial regression, we analysed risk of disability by age at diabetes diagnosis, and risk of YOD by educational level and country background. The risk of being dependent on disability benefits was three times higher in YOD (adjusted incidence rate ratio, aIRR (95% CI) 3.1 (2.7 to 3.5)) and twice as high in later-onset T2D (1.9 (1.8 to 2.1)) as in the general population. People of Norwegian background with low educational levels had threefold higher YOD risk (3.3 (2.4 to 4.4)) than those with a tertiary degree, while people of non-Western backgrounds with low educational levels had a smaller increase in YOD risk (1.5 (1.1 to 2.1)). People of non-Western backgrounds had higher YOD risk than those of Norwegian background (4.2 (3.5 to 5.0)), while people of south Asian background had an even greater relative YOD risk (9.0 (7.3 to 11.0)), threefold higher than for later-onset T2D (3.2 (2.8 to 3.7)). Lifetime risk of being dependent on disability benefits was substantially higher for individuals with YOD than in later onset T2D. Non-Western and particularly south Asian backgrounds were associated with increased YOD risk. Low education was an important YOD risk factor only for people with Norwegian background.

Sarcopenia is the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function, significantly contributing to frailty, disability, and mortality in aging populations. As life expectancy rises, sarcopenia presents a growing public health challenge, increasing healthcare costs, and diminishing quality of life. Despite its prevalence, sarcopenia is often underdiagnosed due to limitations in current diagnostic tools, including the lack of standardized cut-off values and reliance on physical performance tests. The causes of sarcopenia are multifactorial, involving oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, satellite cell depletion, and impaired angiogenesis. Recent research highlights the role of microRNAs (miRs) in regulating these molecular pathways. miRs influence muscle homeostasis by modulating gene expression related to muscle atrophy, apoptosis, inflammation, and insulin resistance. While non-pharmacological interventions such as resistance training and blood flow restriction therapy remain the primary treatment strategies, their effectiveness is often limited in older adults with reduced muscle regenerative capacity. The identification of miRs as biomarkers could enhance early diagnosis and enable more personalized treatment approaches. However, further research is required to validate their clinical utility and therapeutic potential. This review comprehensively analyses the molecular mechanisms underlying sarcopenia, current diagnostic challenges, and emerging miR-based strategies that could transform its management. Future efforts should focus on integrating these molecular insights into clinical practice to improve early detection and intervention strategies.

Numerous clinical and epidemiological studies have demonstrated altered immune activity in adult depression patients, yet comparable data in youth are scarce. This study investigated the relationship between depression severity and peripheral immune measures in a clinical sample of children and adolescents. We analyzed 1198 blood samples from 819 patients (age range: 8-18 years) diagnosed with mild, moderate, or severe depression disorder using ICD-10 criteria. Immune cell counts, immune cell ratios, and C-reactive protein were quantified from the samples. Associations between immune measures and depression severity were examined using multilevel regression models. Patients' age moderated the associations between depression severity and immune measures with higher severity being associated with increased cell counts of monocytes, eosinophiles, and basophiles in older patients. In longitudinal analyses of patients with data from multiple timepoints, we found higher CRP levels to predict more severe depression over time. Our findings suggest that immune dysregulation in youth depression may not fully follow patterns established in adult populations, but they progressively approximate the patterns seen in adults as children grow older. This underscores the importance of conducting research on immunological changes in depression in youth and over the lifespan.

To map the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), OKS Activity & Participation Questionnaire, Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), and High Activity Arthroplasty Score to a common scale using principles of modern test theory. Using the common scale, we then aimed to build a computerized adaptive test (CAT) to reduce item burden. Participants undergoing total knee arthroplasty provided preoperative and postoperative (six and 12 months) paired responses for four patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) instruments, with the OKS being the common linking instrument. After meeting assumptions (unidimensionality, monotonicity, local independence, and measurement invariance), a graded response model was fitted to the data. A CAT algorithm was developed. There were 6,301 paired responses included. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the four PROM instruments measured a similar or very similar latent construct, which we describe as 'knee health'. The combination of all four instruments resulted in higher test-level information than any individual instrument. The CAT reduced 36 items to a median of eight items, while maintaining high measurement precision (standard error of measurement 0.29). The common metric provides a more precise measurement of knee health than any of the individual instruments, and avoids floor and ceiling effects inherent in individual scores. The CAT algorithm reduced the item burden to a median of eight items, which is lower than the FJS or OKS, when used as individual instruments. It will also allow for standardization of outcome reporting and pooling of results across databases that use any of the four instruments to facilitate individual and meta-analyses across different scores.

Migraine is a common neurological disorder that is increasingly recognized for its systemic effects extending beyond the central nervous system. Emerging evidence suggests a potential association between migraine and cardiovascular dysfunction; however, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain insufficiently elucidated. In this study we aimed to evaluate atrial electromechanical delay in patients with migraine and to test the hypothesis that migraine may be linked to subclinical cardiac alterations, particularly in atrial conduction. This cross-sectional study included 136 participants: 55 patients diagnosed with migraine and 81 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. All participants underwent standardized clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic evaluations at a tertiary care center. Migraine patients demonstrated significantly prolonged P max and P dispersion values compared to controls (Pmax: 196 ± 44 vs. 131 ± 42 ms, p < 0.001; Pdisp: 133 ± 44 vs. 63 ± 23 ms, p < 0.001), indicating increased intra-atrial conduction heterogeneity. Although interatrial electromechanical delay did not differ significantly between groups, migraine patients exhibited prolonged lateral and medial atrial conduction times compared to controls (p < 0.05). These abnormalities were observed despite the absence of overt cardiovascular disease. This study supports the hypothesis that migraine is associated with subclinical atrial conduction disturbances, as evidenced by elevated P-wave dispersion and atrial electromechanical delay. These findings highlight the importance of cardiovascular monitoring in migraine patients, particularly those with aura or existing vascular risk factors. Further longitudinal investigations are necessary to determine whether these electrical changes have prognostic value in predicting future cardiovascular events.

Background and Objectives: During pandemics, emergency departments face the challenge of managing critically ill patients with limited resources. Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) has emerged as a crucial diagnostic tool in such scenarios. This study aimed to develop a standardized POCUS protocol using expert consensus via a modified Delphi survey to guide physicians in managing these patients more effectively. Materials and Methods: A committee of emergency imaging experts and board-certified emergency physicians identified essential elements of POCUS in the treatment of patients under investigation (PUI) with shock, sepsis, or other life-threatening diseases. A modified Delphi survey was conducted among 39 emergency imaging experts who were members of the Korean Society of Emergency Medicine. The survey included three rounds of expert feedback and revisions, leading to the development of a POCUS protocol for critically ill patients during a pandemic. Results: The developed POCUS protocol emphasizes the use of POCUS-echocardiography and POCUS-lung ultrasound for the evaluation of cardiac and respiratory function, respectively. The protocol also provides guidance on when to consider additional tests or imaging based on POCUS findings. The Delphi survey results indicated general consensus on the inclusion of POCUS-echocardiography and POCUS-lung ultrasound within the protocol, although there were some disagreements regarding specific elements. Conclusions: Effective clinical practice aids emergency physicians in determining appropriate POCUS strategies for differential diagnosis between life-threatening diseases. Future studies should investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of the protocol in actual clinical scenarios, including its impact on patient outcomes, resource utilization, and workflow efficiency in emergency departments.

Emergency departments (ED) and intensive care units (ICU) in general hospitals can contribute to preventive care for patients with suicidality. Despite the availability of guidelines worldwide, challenges remain in providing such care. In the Netherlands, it is unclear to what extent suicide prevention is implemented in acute hospital care. Cross-sectional survey among ED and ICU professionals in 18 hospitals between 2020 and 2022. Primary outcomes were self-reported levels of knowledge and confidence in managing patients with suicidality. Secondary outcomes included self-reported familiarity with the national guideline and suicide prevention organisation, training uptake, guideline adherence, available institutional resources, and perceived needs to improve care. Using multivariable regression analysis, primary outcomes and guideline adherence were compared between healthcare professions, departments and hospitals. A total of 736 healthcare professionals (67% ED/33% ICU) participated. Reported knowledge and confidence were modest: 53% of ED staff and 42% of ICU staff scored ≥ 3 on knowledge, and 84% and 63% scored ≥ 3 on confidence (1–5 scale). Among ED and ICU staff, 85%/90% reported insufficient knowledge of the guideline, 42%/52% unfamiliarity with the national suicide prevention organization and 18%/29% had never participated in suicide prevention training or professional development. Mean guideline adherence scores were 3.5 (ED) and 3.6 (ICU); institutional resources scored 2.3 (ED) and 2.6 (ICU) (1–5 scale). Perceived needs included improved access to psychiatric review, expert consultation, training and education. Levels of knowledge and confidence were higher among ED staff and medical doctors compared to ICU staff and nurses. Guideline adherence varied markedly between hospitals. Despite the existence of a national guideline, Dutch EDs and ICUs face challenges in implementing comprehensive suicide prevention. Barriers exist at individual and organizational levels. A multi-level approach is needed, including staff training to improve knowledge, organisational commitment, and local protocols outlining essential steps and role clarity for acute care professionals.

Neurogenic bladder and lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunctions encompass a wide variety of urinary disorders resulting from nervous system impairments. Unfortunately, conventional treatments are still limited and can have significant complication rates, especially when stent implantations or other surgical procedures are involved. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop novel therapeutic strategies and pharmacological approaches to address these challenging urological conditions. Recent technological advances offer promising solutions to overcome some of these challenges faced by patients with bladder and LUT dysfunction. This review summarizes recent progress in advanced urotechnologies, focusing on bladder monitoring and neuromodulation approaches, advanced medical instruments and devices, and the latest wireless, battery-free bioelectronic implants for bladder care. These emerging engineered platforms offer the potential for real-time monitoring and improved patient outcomes while minimizing the risks associated with traditional treatments. Outlook and future directions are also discussed, highlighting how technological innovations-enabled by interdisciplinary efforts-can lead to next-generation urotechnologies. These include multimodal closed-loop strategies, artificial intelligence, deep-tissue sensing techniques, and other approaches aimed at addressing a wide variety of complex urological conditions affecting the bladder and beyond.

Cognitive deficits significantly contribute to the disability related to schizophrenia. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of high-frequency rTMS intervention in the improvement of cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. One-hundred patients of predominantly negative schizophrenia having cognitive deficits were enrolled for this randomized, sham controlled, double-blind trial. Active group received 20 sessions of rTMS at 20 Hz frequency and 100% motor threshold with total 2000 pulses over 4 weeks. Those receiving 5 consecutive rTMS sessions were included in primary and safety analysis. The trial protocol was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI/2019/05/019099). An intention to treat (ITT) analysis was conducted for the intervention. A total of 497 patients were screened, with 100 randomized to active (n = 50) and sham (n = 50) rTMS groups. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups. The mean total scores and dysfunction ratings on the PGI Memory Scale, as well as performance on other cognitive measures, did not differ significantly between active and sham groups at any assessment point. Within the active rTMS group, significant improvements over time were observed in total dysfunction rating (P = 0.018), delayed recall (P = 0.042), immediate recall (P = 0.039), and verbal retention of dissimilar pairs (P = 0.014). A significant between-group difference was found only for remote memory change at 1-month follow-up (P = 0.016). Two adverse events were reported in the active group (one partial seizure, one case of aggravated psychosis), leading to discontinuation of intervention; no serious adverse events occurred in the sham group. High-frequency rTMS resulted in modest improvement in specific cognitive measures, most notably remote memory in the active group at 1-month follow-up, but did not demonstrate significant overall group differences in cognitive outcomes compared to sham. It builds ground for further research assessing for delayed effects using neuronavigational methods.
40909114	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	(Un)timely care: findings from the Waiting Times project.	There is a historic crisis in waiting times in the UK's National Health Service. Crisis brings both a call for judgement - a response to the question 'what has gone wrong?' - and a call to action, such as better management, more resources, strategies to mitigate staff burnout, or even a shift in access commitments to reduce demand. However, not all forms of waiting are a sign of service inefficiency or failure, or a form of abandonment or lack of care. Instead, we argue that all healthcare entails waiting, and other forms of elongated time such as pausing to observe, staying alongside patients at end of life, enduring or even encouraging the repeated presentations of those with medically unexplained symptoms, delaying treatment to see what time will bring the situation, or stopping treatment as an ethical intervention. In this paper, we offer three examples of care practices that require waiting, demanding considerable patience on the part of patients and healthcare workers: care for the chronically unwell in general practice; care of young people in mental health crisis; and care for trans and gender-questioning young people. When time is represented as a finite linear resource to be used efficiently, 'streamlining', speeding up systems, and making cuts to 'wasteful' practices seem like obvious solutions. But we argue that it is only by reckoning with the complex relationality and fundamental untimeliness of the care that runs alongside even the most timely interventions, that we can understand what it means to wait in and for the NHS, and what resources might be needed for the service and its users to flourish.

Background: Myasthenia gravis (MG), a chronic autoimmune disorder with variable disease trajectories, presents considerable challenges for clinical stratification and acute care management. This systematic review evaluated machine learning models developed for prognostic assessment in patients with MG. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for relevant articles published from January 2010 to May 2025. Studies using machine learning techniques to predict MG-related outcomes based on structured or semi-structured clinical variables were included. We extracted data on model targets, algorithmic strategies, input features, validation design, performance metrics, and interpretability methods. The risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Results: Eleven studies were included, targeting ICU admission (n = 2), myasthenic crisis (n = 1), treatment response (n = 2), prolonged mechanical ventilation (n = 1), hospitalization duration (n = 1), symptom subtype clustering (n = 1), and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted examination scoring (n = 3). Commonly used algorithms included extreme gradient boosting, random forests, decision trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and logistic regression. Reported AUC values ranged from 0.765 to 0.944. Only two studies employed external validation using independent cohorts; others relied on internal cross-validation or repeated holdout. Of the seven prognostic modeling studies, four were rated as having high risk of bias, primarily due to participant selection, predictor handling, and analytical design issues. The remaining four studies focused on unsupervised symptom clustering or AI-assisted examination scoring without predictive modeling components. Conclusions: Despite promising performance metrics, constraints in generalizability, validation rigor, and measurement consistency limited their clinical application. Future research should prioritize prospective multicenter studies, dynamic data sharing strategies, standardized outcome definitions, and real-time clinical workflow integration to advance machine learning-based prognostic tools for MG and support improved patient care in acute settings.

Mealtime assistance is essential in long-term care for older adults with dementia, as it promotes autonomy, social interaction, and dignity. Flexible and accessible training for direct care workers (DCWs) is crucial in improving mealtime support. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a YouTube-based mealtime assistance education program for dementia care based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. The intervention was designed to provide accessible and flexible training for DCWs in care facilities. A quasi-experimental, mixed-methods design was used. Twenty-four DCWs and five supervising nurses from two long-term care facilities participated in this study. To maximize participation, DCWs were non-randomly assigned to the intervention based on facility recommendations and individual work schedules. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated using Kirkpatrick's four-level model. Reactions were measured by collecting satisfaction data from the DCWs through surveys and focus group interviews (FGIs). Learning outcomes were assessed using self-reported questionnaires to measure mealtime assistance knowledge with pre- and post-intervention comparisons. Behavioral changes were evaluated by supervising nurses using an observation-based questionnaire and analyzed using pre- and post-intervention data. Organizational results and the dissemination effect were explored through FGIs with nurses and thematically analyzed. The median mealtime assistance knowledge score increased significantly (Pre: 91.67, Post: 100.00, p = .002, effect size = 0.45, interquartile range: 83.3-97.92). The median mealtime assistance behavior score showed significant improvement (Pre: 67.00, Post: 92.00, p < .001, effect size = 0.56, interquartile range: 82.33-92.00). Supervising nurses observed enhanced ethical attitudes and behavioral changes among DCWs during mealtime assistance. YouTube-based multimedia learning interventions effectively improved the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of DCWs in mealtime assistance for older adults with dementia. Its accessibility and practicality suggest that this approach can be a useful educational model in long-term care settings. Further studies are needed to explore the role of opinion leaders in sustaining and expanding these effects.

Euglena sanguinea (Ehrenberg 1831) is one of the earliest reported species within the genus Euglena. Its prolific proliferation leading to red algal bloom has garnered significant scientific attention due to its ecological and environmental impacts. Despite this, research on E. sanguinea remains relatively sparse. In this study, we isolated and purified algal strains collected from the water of the Shanghai Botanical Garden, identifying them as E. sanguinea based on 16S and 23S rDNA sequence alignment. The cellular density and carotenoids content of E. sanguinea were observed to vary under different abiotic culture conditions, including varying temperatures, light intensities, potassium iodide and sucrose concentration. Notably, significant rapid accumulation of carotenoids in E. sanguinea was observed under continuous culture at a light intensity of 130 µmol m- 2 s - 1. Furthermore, exposure to a strong light intensity resulted in changes in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Moreover, through de novo transcriptome sequencing and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of E. sanguinea cultured under different light intensities, we identified a total of 111 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), comprising 44 upregulated and 67 downregulated genes. Among these, eight genes are associated with photosynthesis and chloroplast function, including upregulated genes encoding Photosystem II protein D1, Photosystem II protein K, and Cytochrome b6/f complex subunit V, as well as translation elongation factor EF-Tu; conversely, downregulated genes include those encoding cell wall-associated hydrolases and enzymes involved in carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. These findings provide foundational data for investigating the photoprotective mechanisms in E. sanguinea and serve as a reference for the regulatory factors involved in carotenoids biosynthesis within Euglena.

Outcome studies have shown the benefits of inhalation consultations. Therefore, the service of inhalation consultations from pharmacists has been implemented in guidelines. Recently, this service became reimbursable for German community pharmacies. We aimed to investigate how this service is performed under routine conditions to actually achieve the proven benefits. We evaluated the reimbursed inhalation service under routine conditions in community pharmacies in Saxony, Germany. An external trained monitor observed routine services and documented predefined handling errors in patients' inhalation demonstrations. Besides, the monitor checked which contents of predefined checklists were addressed. After the consultations, patients and pharmaceutical staff were asked about the pervious service via a questionnaire. We analysed 48 reimbursed inhalation services in 13 different community pharmacies. Most consultations were on metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers, with 42% (20/48) each. We observed a median of n = 2 handling errors per patient (Q25: 1; Q75: 3). On average, 77% of those two errors were addressed by the pharmaceutical staff during the following consultation (95% confidence interval [69%; 86%]; minimum: 0%; maximum: 100%). Overall, patients' contentment with the service was very high (overall median: 5), while pharmaceutical staff's contentment was high (overall median: 4). There was no correlation between duration and unaddressed errors (r = 0.16; p = 0.35) or patients' contentment (r = 0.19; p = 0.26). Handling errors in patients' inhalation technique were common but mostly recognized and addressed by the pharmaceutical staff during the reimbursed inhalation service. Patients' contentment with the service was high to very high, and they were usually more content with the service than the pharmaceutical staff.

The ψ directionality index was introduced by Peter & Slatkin (Evolution 67: 3274-3289, 2013) to infer the direction of range expansions from single-nucleotide polymorphism variation. Computed from the joint site frequency spectrum for two populations, ψ uses shared genetic variants to measure the difference in the amount of genetic drift experienced by the populations, associating excess drift with greater distance from the origin of the range expansion. Although ψ has been successfully applied in natural populations, its statistical properties have not been well understood. In this paper, we define Ψ as a random variable originating from a coalescent process in a two-population demography. For samples consisting of a pair of diploid genomes, one from each of two populations, we derive expressions for moments E[Ψk] for standard parameterizations of bottlenecks during a founder event. For the expectation E[Ψ], we identify parameter combinations that represent distinct demographic scenarios yet yield the same value of E[Ψ]. We also show that the variance V[Ψ] increases with the time since the bottleneck and bottleneck severity, but does not depend on the size of the ancestral population; the ancestral population size affects ψ computed from many biallelic loci only through its contribution to the total number of loci available for the computation. Finally, we analyze the values of E[Ψ] computed from existing demographic models of Drosophila melanogaster and compare them with empirically computed ψ. Our work builds the foundation for theoretical treatments of the ψ index and can help in evaluating its behavior in empirical applications.

Length of stay (LOS) is a substantial driver of costs following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), leading to increased efforts targeting same-day discharge. However, patient selection for same-day discharge TKA remains a challenge, with 7 to 49% of patients failing to achieve planned same-day discharge with current stratification tools. This study aimed to develop and assess multiclass machine learning models for patient selection for same-day discharge TKA as well as risk for prolonged LOS using a large national patient cohort. The database was queried to identify 167,859 primary TKAs between 2017 and 2023. The LOS was categorized into same-day discharge (LOS = zero days), discharge within one to three days, and prolonged LOS (> three days). Machine learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), random forests (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost, were developed and evaluated using the confusion matrix, Cohen's kappa, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Same-day discharge, discharge within one to three days, and prolonged LOS rates were 2.1, 88.1, and 9.8%, respectively. The RF demonstrated the best performance in predicting different LOS groups with an average precision of 90.2% and a recall of 90.3%. For multiclass classification, RF had an accuracy of 90.3%, a Cohen's kappa of 0.85, and a micro-averaged AUC of 0.97. Prominent predictors of LOS included anesthesia type, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, hypertension, age, and operation time. Our findings demonstrate the ability of machine learning models to accurately identify same-day discharge-eligible and at-risk patients for prolonged LOS after primary TKA. Our models may assist surgeons with patient selection for outpatient surgery, thereby improving outcomes, resource allocation, and cost efficiency of TKA.

BackgroundSubstance use is an important contributor to morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization in the United States. While prior research has explored regional differences in substance use and related hospitalizations, the geographic variation in substance-related ICU admissions remains underexplored. We sought to compare the prevalence of ICU admissions involving substance use across geographic divisions and between urban and rural ICUs in the United States.MethodsUsing the national PINC AI Healthcare Database, we performed a retrospective observational study of adult ICU admissions between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019 with a substance-related ICD-10 diagnosis. We calculated the proportion of all ICU admissions with diagnoses related to any substance, and separately for alcohol, opioids, and stimulants and compared these across U.S. Census divisions and between urban and rural ICUs.ResultsOut of 4,740,799 ICU admissions, 760,153 (16.0%) included at least one substance-related diagnosis. The highest burden of substance-related diagnoses was observed in the New England, Pacific, and Mountain divisions, where alcohol and opioid-related ICU admissions were most prevalent. Stimulant-related ICU admissions were disproportionately higher in the Pacific division. Urban ICUs generally reported a higher proportion of substance-related admissions compared to rural ICUs, with certain regional exceptions.ConclusionThere are substantial geographic and urban-rural differences in substance-related ICU admissions across the United States. Our findings suggest a need for region-specific strategies to address distinct substance use patterns and reduce the burden on critical care resources.

Constructing heterogeneous dual-site catalysts is anticipated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, compared to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), the triggering oxide pathway mechanism (OPM) for catalysts poses challenges due to elusive structural evolution and low intrinsic activity. Herein, considering the distinct adsorption propensity of heterogeneous Ni-Fe sites toward differential intermediates (OH-O), the PO43--induced deep reconstruction triggers a dual-site Ni-Fe discrepant oxide pathway mechanism (DOPM) for R-PO4-NiCoFeOOH. Highly oxidized Ni/Fe actives exhibit moderate intermediate *OH/*O adsorption energies and form adjacent sites with modulated spatial configuration, stimulating localized discrepant radical coupling (Ni-*OH-O*-Fe) around leachable POx sites, expediting OER kinetics. Thus, R-PO4-NiCoFeOOH demonstrates ultralow overpotentials of 230/258 mV at 100 mA cm-2 and robust 1500-h durability in alkaline/seawater. Additionally, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer merely requires a cell voltage of 1.81 V to deliver 1.0 A cm-2 and maintains 300-h stable operation. This work provides a methodology for triggering the DOPM of catalysts.

Malnutrition and sarcopenia may occur concurrently (Malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome, MSS) in gastric cancer patients, affecting the prognosis and clinical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate MSS prevalence and oral nutritional supplements (ONS) efficacy. This study included a retrospective analysis of 761 gastric cancer patients post-resection to assess MSS prevalence/prognosis, and a prospective non-randomized trial enrolled 81 MSS patients comparing ONS (500 kcal/day ×4 wk) versus standard care. In the retrospective cohort, MSS prevalence was 20.2%, and MSS independently predicted higher postoperative complication (OR: 2.330, 95% CI: 1.256-4.321, p = 0.007), recurrence/metastasis (OR: 4.162, 95% CI: 1.965-8.815, p < 0.001) and worse overall survival (HR: 1.649, 95% CI: 1.007-2.700, p = 0.047). In the prospective trial, ONS significantly improved weight maintenance compared to standard care (p = 0.032). Non-significant trends were observed in ONS group for shorter postoperative length of stay (PLOS) (6.8 vs 8.0 days), fewer complications (5.0% vs 22.0%) and improved handgrip strength (HGS) recovery (0.1 kg vs -0.9 kg). MSS is prevalent in gastric cancer and associated with adverse outcomes. ONS effectively preserves weight and shows recovery benefits, supporting its integration into MSS management.

Imaging continues to have a crucial role in evaluating patients with shoulder pain, helping to make treatment choices. Magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA), rather than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is now routinely used to diagnose shoulder injuries. Against the gold standard investigation of arthroscopy, the study aimed to determine the accuracy of MRA in the evaluation of shoulder injuries. From June 2017 to May 2019, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care health setup in North India. A total of 50 individuals were enrolled for diagnostic imaging with rotator cuff (RC) pathology. Patients were assessed using an MRA and their clinical history. In comparison with the gold standard for arthroscopy, the sensitivity (Sn), positive predictive value (PPV), and diagnostic accuracy (DA) of MRA for diagnosing shoulder injuries were evaluated. A P value under 0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of the patients was 37.32 ± 12.78 years. There were seven women and 43 (86%) men. The different lesions were superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) tear (24 (48%)), Bankart lesions (19 (38%)), anterior labral periosteal sleeve avulsion (ALSPA) (4 (8%)), partial articular supraspinatus tendon avulsion (PASTA) lesion (2 (4%)), and Buford lesions (1 (2%)). The Sn, PPV, and DA of MRA were 98%, 100%, and 98%, respectively, for identifying the shoulder injury. It was concluded that MRA was reasonably accurate at diagnosing shoulder injuries. MRA demonstrated an excellent 98% Sn in identifying shoulder injuries and missed only one case of shoulder injury, suggesting that it can be an advantageous imaging tool for recognizing and evaluating shoulder injuries for immediate diagnosis and management.

VEXAS syndrome is a rare disorder marked by systemic inflammation and blood disorders, caused by somatic mutations in the UBA1 gene of hematopoietic stem cells. Ocular manifestations are common in VEXAS syndrome. This study reports a 63-year-old male presenting with recurrent periorbital and orbital inflammation, dacryoadenitis, and orbital myositis. He first developed orbital inflammation in the right orbit, later in the left orbit. He was treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. During a 2-year follow-up, he developed multi-organ inflammatory disorder and recurrence of orbital inflammation whenever the systemic corticosteroid dose fell below 20 mg/day. Ultimately, he was diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome. Identification of VEXAS syndrome in elder male patients with orbital inflammation is essential for tailored management. Treatment typically involves corticosteroids and, in refractory cases, Janus kinase inhibitors like ruxolitinib or IL-6 inhibitors. This case highlights the importance of considering VEXAS syndrome in the differential diagnosis of orbital inflammation, particularly in elderly males with concurrent inflammatory and hematologic abnormalities.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a therapeutic option for diseases such as epilepsy and depression. Given that the smooth muscle of the bronchi is innervated by the vagus nerve, VNS could aid in treating pathologies of the respiratory system involving a bronchoconstrictive component. The aim of this review is to evaluate the literature on the potential for VNS to relieve airway bronchoconstriction in asthma. A systematic review of several databases (PubMed, Embase and Scopus) was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies of individuals (humans and animals) with asthma symptoms were included if they reported respiratory function outcomes. Two authors independently reviewed all papers for selection, methodological assessment, and data extraction. A total of 2072 articles were identified, of which 1,528 unique articles were screened for inclusion. 30 relevant articles underwent full-text review, and six articles (four in humans; two in animals) were included. One human article was subsequently added manually due to a new finding in an updated search. Due to incomplete data reporting, meta-analysis was not possible. In both animal studies, low-voltage VNS improved respiratory function following a histamine or acetylcholine challenge. In human studies (one case report, two prospective interventional cohort studies, one randomized controlled study), VNS, in addition to standard-of-care anti-asthmatic therapy, appears to temporarily improve respiratory function. Limited low-quality evidence suggests low-voltage VNS appears to reduce bronchoconstriction in both animal and human subjects. Given concerns about translatability, the absence of a control group in most studies, and the concomitant use of anti-asthmatic pharmacotherapy, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the true magnitude of VNS's effect on respiratory function and acute asthma progression. Well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT) are needed to further evaluate the effectiveness of VNS in treating acute asthmatic bronchoconstriction and to better understand its underlying therapeutic mechanisms.

Cancer vaccines represent a transformative shift in oncology, aiming to prevent malignancies or treat established cancers by training the immune system to recognize tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens. This review explores the diverse platforms and mechanisms supporting cancer vaccines, ranging from prophylactic vaccines such as HPV and hepatitis B vaccines that have significantly reduced virus-related cancers to therapeutic vaccines like Sipuleucel-T and T-VEC that extend survival in prostate cancer and melanoma. Vaccine types are classified, and delivery platforms including mRNA, peptide, dendritic cell and viral vector-based approaches are examined alongside pivotal clinical trial outcomes. Key barriers to vaccine efficacy include tumor immune evasion, heterogeneity and the suppressive tumor microenvironment; combination therapies with checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy are evaluated for their potential to overcome these challenges. Despite promising trials, challenges persist in neoantigen selection, biomarker development, regulatory approval and scalable vaccine manufacturing. Data on current global utilization, approved indications and coverage disparities particularly in low and middle-income countries are presented. Furthermore, the cancer vaccine market is segmented by disease type, platform technology and region, with rising investments in personalized mRNA platforms and combined immunotherapies driving growth. In conclusion, cancer vaccines offer a less toxic, more precise approach to cancer prevention and treatment. Continued innovation, global collaboration, and infrastructure development are essential to realizing their full potential in improving patient outcomes and reducing the global cancer burden.

Aging may place patients at greater risk for adverse perioperative outcomes. We hypothesized that women undergoing minimally invasive (MIS) sacrocolpopexy aged ≥ 70 years are more likely to experience adverse events (AE) within 8 weeks of surgery. We performed a secondary analysis of a retrospective study on perioperative adverse events in women ≥ 61 years old undergoing prolapse surgery at a single academic center from January 2016 to May 2023. Only women undergoing MIS sacrocolpopexy were included. The primary outcome was a composite 8-week AE outcome. Secondary outcomes included prolapse recurrence and mesh complication. Variables were compared between the groups using t-test (or Mann-Whitney U) and chi-square (or Fisher's exact) analyses. Multivariable logistic regression was performed, controlling for variables with p < 0.05 on univariate analysis. Of the 709 women who underwent MIS sacrocolpopexy, 29.9% (n = 212) were aged ≥ 70 years. Age ≥ 70 was not significantly associated with 8-week perioperative AEs, nor was it associated with prolapse recurrence or mesh complication. The composite AE outcome was not associated with age ≥ 70 on multivariable analysis, controlling for CCI score, robotic approach, and concomitant hysterectomy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.38-1.10]). Women aged ≥ 70 years had a 73% lesser adjusted odds of surgical site infections on multivariable analysis (95% CI [0.08-0.93]). Age ≥ 70 years is not associated with perioperative AEs, prolapse recurrence, or mesh complication. These findings highlight the safety profile of this surgical approach in older women, an important consideration for urogynecologic surgeons caring for an aging population.
40880525	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article;Observational Study	Efficacy of biomarkers in the endochondral phase of fracture repair and healing in long bones: A clinical observational studys.	Clinical determination of bone fracture healing remains qualitative, typically determined through the combination of plain film radiographs, clinical assessment, and patient-reported pain. Importantly, standard radiographs can only detect bone formation in the fracture site after sufficient tissue mineralization has occurred, restricting utility to the later stages of bone repair. A more rigorous method for determining fracture healing progression could significantly improve patient care. Quantitative biomarkers have gained diagnostic value in many clinical indications. Multiple bone turnover biomarkers have been successfully utilized for diagnosis and clinical management of osteoporosis. However, there remains limited evidence for the correlation and diagnostic efficacy of these biomarkers when applied to fracture repair. Here we present data from a large cohort of participants without (n = 111) or with (n = 153) fracture with the primary outcome of interest our blood-based biomarker which detects the degradation product of the trimeric collagen X protein (CXM). Collagen X is a transient extracellular matrix protein synthesized by hypertrophic chondrocytes during the soft callus phase of endochondral fracture repair. Our data show that healthy patients with an age range of 21-85 years without fracture (enrolled 2018-2020) have low circulating levels of CXM (median = 563.4 pg/mL; interquartile range (IQR) [483.2, 771.1]) that do not vary independently with age (r = 0.04, p = 0.26) or sex (p = 0.42). Fracture data includes patients with an acute closed or low grade open (Gustilo type I or II) tibial or femoral shaft fracture from a secondary analysis of the VitaShock study (NCT02786498, n = 102: enrolled through the University of Maryland 2016-2019), complemented by a new prospectively enrolled observational study that recruited from the Oregon Health & Science University level 1 academic trauma center (n = 51: enrolled 2019-2023) that were followed until the patient was deemed clinically healed or until they failed to return for follow-up. We show that in serum CXM positively correlates to the bone biomarkers N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP, r = 0.50, p < 0.0001), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX, r = 0.40, p < 0.0001), and osteocalcin (r = 0.26, p = 0.0411); with a negative correlation to the obesity biomarker leptin (r = -0.31, p = 0.0138). Further, patients with early healing exhibited a peak in CXM at 6 weeks of 1,092 pg/mL (95% confidence interval (CI) [804.8, 1,379]), which was significantly higher than patients with normal healing of 630.8 pg/mL (95% CI [399.9, 861.8]; p = 0.016). We then show that we can reliably transfer this assay from serum collection through venipuncture to a dried blood spot (DBS) collected by finger prick (r = 0.75, Serum = 0.4217*DBS + 181.9, p < 0.0001). Using DBS, the prospective clinical observational study finally suggests that median time-to-peak CXM is at 25.5 days following the elimination of outliers (n = 6) using Robust Regression and Outlier Removal (ROUT, Q = 1%). This study did not find significant differences in CXM expression according to age, sex, or bone that are likely due to the main limitation of an observational study. This rigorous data set supports the future prospective use of the CXM biomarker collected by finger prick in interventional fracture studies and/or in observational studies requiring quantitative assessments of long-bone healing.

Explore the changes in the burden of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) caused by occupational formaldehyde exposure from 1990 to 2021, and predict its development trend up to 2050, to provide references for formulating relevant policies and measures. Using the Global Burden of Disease database 2021 (GBD 2021), we counted and analyzed the numbers and standardized rates of NPC deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by occupational formaldehyde exposure globally, in 21 regions, and in 204 countries. Combined with correlation analysis, health inequality analysis, and frontier analysis, we further comprehensively described the disease burden and its changing trends. In addition, we used the Bayesian age-period-cohort model to predict the disease burden from 2022 to 2050. From 1990 to 2021 and from 2022 to 2050, the global disease burden of NPC caused by occupational formaldehyde exposure shows a downward trend. In terms of gender, the disease burden is higher among men than among women. From the perspective of the socio-demographic index (SDI), the disease burden is most severe in regions with lower SDI. Geographically, there are significant differences in the disease burden among different countries and regions, with South Asia, East Asia, and Africa having the highest disease burden. In addition, in terms of age distribution, the disease burden is relatively higher among middle-aged people, especially those aged 45-49. From 1990 to 2021, the disease burden of NPC caused by global occupational formaldehyde exposure showed a downward trend, and the regional burden decreased with the increase of SDI.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis, vascular damage, and immune dysregulation, often leading to muscle abnormalities. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of myopenia and myosteatosis in SSc patients using computed tomography (CT) and their associations with clinical features, including lung disease and esophageal dilatation. SSc patients followed at Gazi University Rheumatology Clinic (2000-2024) who had thoracic CT imaging were included. Muscle mass and density were assessed at the L1 vertebral level. Skeletal muscle area (SMA) and skeletal muscle radiation attenuation (SMRA) were measured to identify myopenia and myosteatosis. Lung disease involvement and widest esophageal diameter (WED) were assessed via CT. Statistical analyses explored correlations between muscle metrics and clinical variables, with multiple linear regression identifying predictors. Among 95 patients (54.7% diffuse SSc, 45.3% limited SSc; mean age 57.04 ± 13.65 years; female-to-male ratio 8.5:1), myopenia and myosteatosis prevalence were 27.3% and 41.1%, respectively. Myosteatosis was associated with female sex (p = 0.001), older age (p = 0.001), higher BMI (p = 0.043), and inflammation markers (CRP, ESR). Myopenia correlated with BMI (p = 0.001) but not clinical outcomes. Higher WED correlated with lower SMRA (p = 0.001). BMI predicted muscle mass (R² = 0.42), while age, gender, and BMI determined SMRA (R² = 0.67, p < 0.001). Myosteatosis was more prevalent and strongly associated with clinical features, including lung disease and esophageal dilatation, than myopenia, underscoring the importance of muscle quality.

"Aging populations have increased demand for hospice palliative care and support for dying persons. More broadly, community support is also becoming an increasingly important aspect of public health intervention. Compassionate communities advocate active bottom-up community participation to strengthen communities' assets around death and dying. However, these rapidly growing initiatives face a challenge in putting values such as cultural diversity, relationship, and love into practice and in making a social impact through ""meaningful participation"" at the community level. Reflecting on our experiences in a recent study of dying at home in Canada, we consider potential challenges for compassionate communities more broadly. We argue that risks related to gendered inequity, neo-liberal discourses around caring work, and an over-emphasis of community resilience need to be deliberated in compassionate community policy and service development. To mitigate these risks, we argue that the eight components of the International Standards for Community Development Practice or ISCDP (from the International Association for Community Development or IACD) provide important direction about putting values into practice, for instance by advocating for service and policy improvement while engaging in practice and research on compassionate communities. We discuss how the international standards can inform compassionate community development in Canada."

Methods for measuring the ultrasound attenuation coefficient (AC) vary across different systems. Some have fixed regions of interest (ROI) while others have movable ROIs. Aims were to evaluate whether, using a system with a fixed ROI, correlation between AC and MRI proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), and performance could be improved by (i) reducing fixed ROI length to 30 mm, changing starting point from the transducer, and (ii) using a movable ROI at different depths. In this retrospective multicenter study, AC measurements were performed with the Arietta 850 system, and raw data were automatically stored. AC values were obtained using a standard commercial algorithm (ROI-setting1, 35-75 mm from transducer). Raw data were successively reprocessed externally using a fixed 45-75 mm ROI (ROI-setting2) and a movable 30 mm ROI positioned with the top at 20 mm (ROI-setting3) and 25 mm below the liver capsule (ROI-setting4). Spearman rho and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) were used to assess correlation with MRI-PDFF and performance, respectively, and the Delong test was used to compare AUROCs. Seven hundred fifty participants (median age: 65 [52, 73] years; 384 males) were included. Correlation of ROI-setting1 with MRI-PDFF was 0.75 (0.72, 0.78), reaching 0.80 (0.77, 0.82) with ROI-setting4. Overall, ROI-setting4 showed significantly the best performance across steatosis grades. AUROCs for S > 0 were 0.90 (0.87, 0.92) for ROI-setting1 and 0.92 (0.90, 0.94) with ROI-setting4 (p < 0.001). This latter performed significantly better than all other settings in participants with obesity and skin-to-liver distance > 25 mm (p < 0.05). A movable ROI improves both AC correlation with MRI-PDFF and performance. The highest improvement was with the ROI top 25 mm below the liver capsule. Question It remains uncertain whether utilizing an ROI at a fixed position from the transducer is optimal for ultrasound AC measurements. Findings The highest AC performance and correlation with MRI-PDFF were observed with a movable ROI positioned with the top at 25 mm under the liver capsule. Clinical relevance A movable ROI with consistent sub-capsular placement improves both correlation between AC and MRI-PDFF, as well as its performance, whereas in individuals with a skin-to-liver capsule distance > 25 mm, a fixed ROI position significantly decreases AC performance.

Colorectal Crohn's disease is prevalent in DS patients, presenting with fatigue, abdominal pain, and strictures, often treated with surgery, immunomodulators, and biotherapy for management. The patient presented with symptoms of abdominal pain, cramping, and significant bowel sounds, along with weight loss and a decreased appetite. Histopathological examination and upper endoscopy were used to diagnose the condition, and a gluten-free dietary treatment was implemented. Crohn's disease can be diagnosed by several methods, including histopathology, and its treatment can involve various approaches, including dietary management. There is a connection with genetic diseases, and it is not necessary for all symptoms and signs of the disease to appear, as they often vary. DS with Crohn's disease is considered a very rare condition, especially in low-income countries and at a young age. It should be taken into account when differentiating diagnoses in autoimmune and intestinal diseases.

There is an association between hypothyroidism and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), but the exact mechanistic link between these two conditions is not fully elucidated. We evaluate the incidence and risks of subsequently developing SIBO, and changes in small bowel microbial populations, in subjects with hypothyroidism or autoimmune thyroiditis. Duodenal aspirates from REIMAGINE study subjects with a history of hypothyroidism (hypothyroid group, N=49) and controls (N=323) underwent 16S rRNA sequencing (MiSeq, Illumina); a subset also underwent metagenomic sequencing (NovaSeq6000, Illumina). Separately, the TriNetX Analytics platform was used to evaluate ten-year cumulative incidences and relative risk [RR] of developing SIBO in subjects with hypothyroidism (unspecified etiology, HUE), and a subset with autoimmune thyroiditis, vs. propensity score matched (PSM) control groups. Among REIMAGINE subjects, SIBO prevalence was higher in the hypothyroid group (32.65%) vs. controls (15.17%). In the TriNetX analysis, ten-year cumulative incidences of SIBO were higher in HUE (RR=2.20) and autoimmune thyroiditis (RR=2.40) subjects vs. matched controls. However, these risks appeared to be mitigated both in HUE (RR=0.33) and autoimmune thyroiditis (RR=0.78) subjects taking levothyroxine. Analyzing the duodenal microbiome, genus Neisseria was part of the core microbiome in the hypothyroid group (Hypo+/SIBO-, Hypo+/SIBO+) but not in non-hypothyroid subjects (Hypo-/SIBO-, Hypo-/SIBO+). Increased prevalence of Gram-negative coliforms occurred in both SIBO+ groups, but Escherichia/Shigella formed part of the core in non-hypothyroid subjects (Hypo-/SIBO+), whereas Klebsiella species were prevalent in hypothyroid group subjects with SIBO (Hypo+/SIBO+). These findings suggest there is an increased risk for development of SIBO in individuals with a history of hypothyroidism which may be ameliorated by treatment, and may involve specific Gram-negative coliforms.

"Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common neurological condition that often goes undiagnosed, especially in children. Characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, it is typically more pronounced in the evening and at rest. Growing Pains (GP), common in childhood and associated with migraine, present apparently overlapping symptoms with RLS, making it sometimes difficult to distinguish between the two. Understanding their relationship is important to make correct diagnosis and treatment. We performed a literature review on PubMed using combinations of terms such as ""Restless Legs Syndrome,"" ""Growing Pains,"" and ""children"" to explore diagnostic criteria and the relationship between RLS and GP. Studies included those from 2000 to 2024 that involved individuals under 18 with diagnosis of RLS or GP, written in English language. The 24 studies we included in our analysis showed that RLS and GP share common physiological factors, including serotonin dysfunction, iron deficiency, and low vitamin D levels. Evidence from genetic studies suggests a familial link in the development of both conditions. These findings suggest that GP might be an early form of RLS. Both conditions are linked with headaches, sleep disorders, and neuropsychiatric conditions like ADHD. Treatment for both conditions includes iron supplements, dopamine agonists, and non-medical approaches such as stretching or physical exercise. Our narrative review shows that, though distinct, RLS and GP might share common underlying causes. RLS and GP are common in pediatric populations, but diagnosis can be challenging due to symptom overlap. This review offers an updated and integrative framework for understanding RLS and GP, highlighting the need for more specific, evidence-based diagnostic criteria. Further research is needed in order to clarify their relationship, refine diagnostic criteria, and explore their genetic and neurobiological mechanisms."

The medical care of patients with rare diseases is a cross-border concern across the EU. This is also reflected in the usage statistics of the SE-ATLAS, where most access occurs via browser languages set to German, English, French, or Polish. The SE-ATLAS website provides information on healthcare services and patient organisations for rare diseases in Germany. As SE-ATLAS currently offers its content almost exclusively in German, non-German-speaking users may encounter language barriers. Against this background, this paper explores whether common machine translation systems can translate medical texts into other languages at a reasonable level of quality. For this purpose, the translation systems DeepL, ChatGPT, and Google Translate were analysed. Translation quality was assessed using the standardised metrics BLEU, METEOR, and COMET. In contrast to subjective human assessments, these automated metrics allow for objective and reproducible evaluation. The analysis focused on machine-generated translations of German-language texts from the OPUS corpus into English, French, and Polish, each compared against existing reference translations. BLEU scores were generally lower than those of the other metrics, whereas METEOR and COMET indicated moderate to high translation quality. Translations into English were consistently rated higher than those into French and Polish. As the three analysed translation systems showed hardly any statistically significant differences in translation quality and all delivered acceptable results, further criteria should be taken into account when choosing an appropriate system. These include factors such as data protection, cost-efficiency, and ease of integration.

Across three pre-registered experiments (n = 264 4-to-6-year-olds recruited in the US between 2018-2022; demographic data not collected), we find that 4-year-olds expect agents to draw on past experiences when acting in new situations. However, only 6-year-olds reliably use this expectation to infer others' knowledge from behavior. These findings suggest that by age 6, children use a causal model of how ignorance shapes behavior, and not just a cue-based understanding of epistemic states."

"Outcomes were to compare the accuracy of 2 large-language models-GPT-4o and o3-Mini-against medical-student performance on otolaryngology-focused, USMLE-style multiple-choice questions. With permission from AMBOSS, we extracted 146 Step 2 CK questions tagged ""Otolaryngology"" and stratified them by AMBOSS difficulty (levels 1-5). Each item was presented verbatim to GPT-4o and o3-Mini through their official APIs; outputs were scored correct/incorrect. Historical, de-identified student responses to the same items served as the comparator. Accuracy (%) was calculated per difficulty tier. Group differences were assessed with one-way ANOVA followed by independent-samples t tests (α=0.05). Mean accuracy across all items was 93.35% for o3-Mini and 90.45% for GPT-4o (P=0.465). Both models outperformed students (55.44%; P=0.008 and 0.012, respectively). Performance for GPT-4o and o3-Mini remained ≥86% across all 5 difficulty levels, whereas student accuracy declined from 85.6% (level 1) to 26.7% (level 5). At the hardest tier, o3-Mini achieved 100% accuracy. GPT-4o and o3-Mini markedly exceed average medical-student performance on ENT-specific USMLE-style questions, maintaining high accuracy even at the greatest difficulty. These findings support the integration of advanced language models as adjunctive learning tools in otolaryngology."

High salt concentrations affect the electron transport chain of bacterial cells, leading to an oxidative stress response that encompasses the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The salt 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) triggers antibacterial activity against the phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum in Bacillus species; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that TTC-inducible activity is related to the formation of ROS and its metabolites. We found that l-ascorbic acid, superoxide dismutase, and catalase counteracted TTC-inducible activity in various Bacillus species. Furthermore, R. solanacearum exhibited a higher susceptibility to H2O2 than Bacillus spp. Genomic analysis showed differences in stress-related genes, with Bacillus strains containing the ROS scavengers bacillithiol and bacillibactin, while glutathione inR. solanacearum. Multivariate analysis indicated that the Bacillus species and TTC influence Bacillus metabolome, resulting in higher levels of quinazoline alkaloids, with potential antibacterial activity against R. solanacearum. Results suggest that TTC induces the production of O2•- and H2O2 and metabolites that arrest R. solanacearum growth.

A simple screening tool is needed for resource-limited settings because rapid treatment is crucial in sepsis. We investigated whether a simplified score, the reverse shock index multiplied by the Glasgow Coma Scale score (rSIG), could replace the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) or the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) for sepsis screening. We used data from a Japanese multicenter prospective observational study. This dataset included patients with suspected infection who were admitted from 35 emergency departments (cohort 1) and patients with suspected infection who were admitted to 22 intensive care units (cohort 2). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission or death within 28 days and mechanical ventilation or death within 28 days in cohort 1 and diagnosis of sepsis, need for invasive support (composite of vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, or death before day 4) in cohort 2. In cohort 1, the AUROC for rSIG was significantly higher for 28-day mortality than for MEWS but not significantly different from that of qSOFA (0.69 [95% CI 0.64-0.74] vs 0.64 [0.59-0.69] vs 0.68 [0.63-0.72]). In cohort 2, the AUROC of rSIG for 28-day mortality was similar to that of MEWS and qSOFA (0.62 [0.56-0.68] vs 0.58 [0.52-0.64] vs 0.62 [0.56-0.67]). The AUROCs for diagnosis of sepsis, ICU admission or 28-day mortality, and mechanical ventilation or 28-day mortality were similar. The AUROC for need of invasive support was significantly higher for rSIG than for MEWS. For most outcomes, rSIG ≥15 had higher sensitivity than a qSOFA ≥2 or a MEWS total ≥5 or any variable ≥3. Although there are limitations in the data, rSIG predicted short-term outcomes in patients with suspected infections as well as or better than MEWS and qSOFA.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) represents a severe and complex subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD), affecting approximately 30% of patients who fail to respond adequately to multiple standard antidepressant therapies. While the pathophysiology of TRD remains incompletely understood, emerging evidence suggests that sex-based biological differences might influence its onset, progression, and treatment response. Women are disproportionately affected by depression and are more likely to experience residual symptoms and treatment resistance, potentially due to hormonal fluctuations, immune system differences, and variations in brain circuitry and neuroplasticity. This narrative explores the current literature on the mechanisms underlying TRD, with a particular emphasis on sex-specific biological factors. Key focus areas include dysregulation in neurotransmitters and neurotrophic pathways, inflammation, HPA axis alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as the influence of sex hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. By highlighting these differences, this review underscores the importance of personalized, sex-informed approaches in the prevention and treatment of TRD and calls for further research to elucidate the biological underpinnings that contribute to sex disparities in treatment outcomes.

Achieving adequate pain control after lung transplantation is an essential milestone in a patient's recovery. We compared postoperative opioid use, clinical outcomes, and respiratory function in lung transplant recipients treated with intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) compared to those receiving standard pain management. We reviewed all adult lung transplants performed at our center between January 2016 and December 2022. We excluded cases performed through median sternotomy and patients with prior thoracotomies, multiorgan transplants, and redo transplants. We performed a propensity score-matched analysis, comparing patients who received INC versus those who received standard pain management. The primary outcome was cumulative postoperative opioid use in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) by postoperative day (POD) 14. Secondary outcomes included opioid use on POD5 and POD10, perioperative outcomes, 1-year survival, and longitudinal measurement of respiratory function. Propensity score matching resulted in 85 patients in each group. Compared to the standard pain management group, the INC group had a lower cumulative opioid use by POD14 (509 MME vs 864 MME; P = .032). In addition, the INC group had less opioid use at POD5, POD10, and POD14; no difference in perioperative outcomes; and similar 1-year survival. The INC group had better respiratory function at 6 and 12 months post-transplant compared to the standard pain management group. In our single-center analysis, INC was associated with less opioid use and improved respiratory function after lung transplant. This report adds to the growing literature supporting the use of INC in multimodal pain management strategies and enhanced recovery protocols in lung transplant.

Severe aortic stenosis (AS) often coexists with mitral regurgitation (MR). This study evaluated the significant evolution of MR in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for AS. This multi-center China Degenerative Valve Disease II Cohort (China-DVD2) Study enrolled patients undergoing TAVR for AS from January 2020 to October 2023. MR severity was assessed at baseline and 12 months post-TAVR. Composite endpoints included all-cause death, heart failure rehospitalization, myocardial infarction, and angina. Among 424 enrolled patients, 130 (31%) had significant MR at baseline. At 12 months, MR improved in 56 (70%) of 80 patients with follow-up, and greater improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)was associated with MR improvement [odds ratios (OR): 0.97, 95% 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-1.00, p = 0.04)]. Patients with MR improvement showed significant New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class improvement at 12-month follow-up. No survival benefit disparity was observed between patients with and without significant baseline MR, but a trend toward lower composite endpoint rate (12.5% vs. 20.8%, log-rank p = 0.49) was observed in patients with MR improvement. Older age [hazard ratios (HR): 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01-1.24, p = 0.04)] and higher systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (SPAP) (HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.09, p = 0.04) were linked to worse outcomes. Most patients with significant MR experienced improvement of NYHA class and MR post TAVR. Baseline significant MR was not linked to worse outcomes, but MR improvement showed a trend toward better prognosis. Older age and higher SPAP predicted worse outcomes.

This case presents a 25-year-old Indian male with no significant past medical history presenting to the emergency department (ED) due to two weeks of productive cough with pleuritic chest pain. The patient presented one week earlier to the ED; however, he left against medical advice and was given a 5-day course of Azithromycin 250 mg that minimally improved his symptoms. He returned to the ED shortly after completing the antibiotics and was admitted for further evaluation. He was diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and started on intravenous antibiotics, then discharged two days later on oral outpatient therapy. One month later, the patient returned to the ED with similar symptoms of worsening productive cough and pleuritic chest pain. CT chest findings revealed a left-sided pleural effusion and large pericardial effusion, which later prompted microbiological testing that confirmed a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A pericardial window was indicated due to tamponade physiology. Although the patient did not present with classic constitutional symptoms of tuberculosis, this case shows the importance of keeping TB high in the differential list among those with recurrent pneumonia and unexplained pleural and pericardial effusions, especially in patients with recent immigration or insidious risk factors, despite how rare pathologies such as pericardial TB can be. Early correct diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic workup, including imaging and microbiological studies, should be ordered to prevent delay in treatment and reduce morbidity.

To assess timing, causes, and potential preventability of unplanned readmissions within 30 days of heart failure hospitalisation and how they vary by age and sex across the population. We conducted a cohort study using hospitalisation data from 2013 to 2017 from all public and most private hospitals in Australia and New Zealand, including 197,648 patients aged ≥18 years (mean age 78.2 [standard deviation 12.3] years, 52.4% male, 13.3% <65 years) with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. The main outcomes included the timing of 30-day unplanned readmissions, the diagnoses associated with these, and their potential preventability. Preventability was determined by categorising readmission diagnoses into the following: 1) potential hospital-acquired complication, 2) recurrent heart failure, 3) clinically related to heart failure, and 4) all other diagnoses. Groups 1 and 2 were deemed most preventable. A total of 43,011 (21.8%) patients had one or more unplanned readmissions within 30 days. The peak readmission risk occurred on days 2-4 post-discharge with 25,318 (58.9%) occurring within 2 weeks. When grouped, diagnoses consistent with a potential hospital-acquired complication (group 1) accounted for 41.7% (most commonly pneumonia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and myocardial infarction), readmission for recurrent heart failure (group 2) comprised 38.2%, and groups 3 and 4 consisted of 11.5% and 8.6%, respectively. Although heart failure hospitalisation occurred more frequently in older adults, the risk of readmission exceeded 20% in all age groups, and the timing and potential preventability were not clinically significantly different across age and sex. The peak risk of unplanned readmission occurred in the first few days after discharge, often for potentially preventable reasons such as hospital-acquired complications and recurrent heart failure. Such early and potentially preventable readmissions suggest many may be related to suboptimal quality of hospital care and discharge practices. Future clinical and policy interventions should target improving hospital-based heart failure care quality to reduce avoidable readmissions.

High-sensitivity, multiparameter sensing is increasingly critical for environmental monitoring and electronics. Existing sensing platforms struggle to integrate precise, rapid, and stable monitoring of parts per billion-level hazardous gases and temperature within a single miniaturized device. This study developed a novel sensor based on two-dimensional (2D) indium selenide (InSe), complemented by first-principles density functional theory calculations elucidating the layer-dependent NO2 adsorption mechanism. The sensor demonstrated exceptional dual-mode performance, achieving a 103.40% response to 2 ppm of NO2 alongside a broad temperature detection range (25-150 °C) with high sensitivity. To enable practical applications, we further integrated the sensor into a portable intelligent monitoring system that features signal acquisition, processing, and alarm. This integrated bifunctional platform significantly advances miniaturized, multiparameter sensing technology, offering a powerful solution for next-generation environmental monitors and devices.

A frequent goal of phage biology is to quantify how well a phage kills a population of host bacteria. Unfortunately, traditional methods to quantify phage success can be time-consuming, limiting the throughput of experiments. Here, we use theory to show how the effects of phages on their hosts can be quantified using bacterial population dynamics measured in a high-throughput microplate reader (automated spectrophotometer). We use mathematical models to simulate bacterial population dynamics where specific phage and bacterial traits are known a priori. We then test common metrics of those dynamics (e.g., growth rate, time and height of peak bacterial density, death rate, extinction time, area under the curve) to determine which best predict: 1) infectivity over the short-term, and 2) phage suppression over the long term. We find that many metrics predict infectivity and are strongly correlated with one another. We also find that metrics can predict phage growth rate, providing an effective way to quantify the combined effects of multiple phage traits. Finally, we show that peak density, time of peak density, and extinction time are the best metrics when comparing across different bacterial hosts or over longer timescales where plasticity or evolution may play a role. In all, we establish a foundation for using bacterial population dynamics to quantify the effects of phages on their bacterial hosts, supporting the design of in vitro empirical experiments using microplate readers.

The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) has been a marker and prognostic indicator of several diseases. However, its utility in pregnancy is unknown. Herein, we reviewed the evidence on the ability of SII to predict gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and preeclampsia (PE). A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science was conducted for studies comparing SII between GDM/PE and non-GDM/non-PE groups. Studies reporting diagnostic accuracy data were also included. The last date of the search was 5 November 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Random-effect meta-analysis was conducted comparing values of SII between GDM/PE and non-GDM/non-PE groups. Nine studies were eligible. Four studies reported data on GDM and five on PE. Most studies measured SII in the first trimester. The pooled analysis showed no statistically significant difference in the SII values between PE and non-PE groups (MD: 13.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): -117.21, 143.35, I2 = 78%). Meta-analysis of four studies comparing data of GDM and non-GDM groups showed that SII was significantly higher in GDM females (MD: 210.32, 95% CI: 57.3, 363.34, I2 = 94%). The sensitivity of SII to predict PE varied from 40 to 77.5% while specificity varied from 53.8 to 67.5%. For studies on GDM, the sensitivity and specificity values varied from 66 to 80.2% and 34.4 to 65%, respectively. SII values are significantly higher in GDM compared to non-GDM females. However, SII values did not correlate with PE. SII may have potential in predicting GDM which needs to be explored by further studies.

To evaluate the implementation effects of problem-solving Quality Control Circle (QCC) activities on medication adherence among outpatient Helicobacter pylori patients. Pharmacists collected data scales, guidance sheets, registration forms, and scoring sheets from outpatient H. pylori patients from January to March 2024. Through brainstorming, factors affecting medication adherence were identified and a series of specific measures were formulated. Implementation was carried out from April to July 2024, and the therapeutic effects of patients before and after implementing the QCC process were evaluated. The total score of patient medication adherence improved from 7.9 to 9.2, with statistically significant results (P < 0.001). The medication compliance rate increased from 57.46% to 87.62%; the adverse reaction incidence decreased from 39 to 11%; the C14 breath test positive rate decreased from 67.2% to 30.65%. All the above results showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.001). Implementing QCC can standardize and improve medication adherence measures for H. pylori patients, which has practical significance for patient treatment outcomes, while also enhancing pharmacists' professional knowledge and skills.

Breast cancer (BC) survivors often experience vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) due to endocrine therapies, affecting quality of life (QoL) and well-being. We aimed to evaluate impact of ospemifene treatment in postmenopausal women with history of BC and moderate to severe VVA. PEONY is a real-world, prospective, multicenter study. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline, after 3 and 6 months. Treatment satisfaction score was the primary outcome. As secondary outcomes, symptoms severity, day-to-day impact of vaginal aging scale, female sexual function index, female sexual distress scale-revised, and SF-12® Health survey were investigated. Sixty-four women with a mean age of 56.4 ± 7.2 years (41.9% with severe VVA) either initiated (35.9%) or continued (64.1%) ospemifene. Treatment satisfaction significantly improved over 6 months, with mean score rising from 7.1 to 7.8 (P = .047). The odds of moderate to severe symptoms, such as vaginal dryness, pain and bleeding during sexual intercourse, genital discomfort during physical activity, burning, and itching, decreased by 70% to 90% at 6 months, as well as recurrent urinary tract infections and cystitis associated with sexual intercourse (by 80% and 90%). QoL measurements showed significant improvements in physical health and daily functioning, although mental health improvements were not statistically significant. Likelihood of sexual distress decreased by 40%. Although overall sexual function remained unchanged, specific domains such as lubrication and pain showed improvement. Ospemifene is effective and well-tolerated for treating moderate to severe VVA of women with history of BC. However, a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is needed to improve sexual function of BC survivors treated for VVA.

The relationship between, and joint selection on, a host and its microbes-the holobiont-can impact evolutionary and ecological outcomes of the host and its microbial community. We develop an agent-based modelling framework for understanding the ecological dynamics of hosts and their microbiomes. Our model incorporates numerous microbial generations per host generation allowing selection on both host and microbes. We then explore host and microbiome fitness and diversity in response to environmental change. We demonstrate that multiple microbial generations can buffer changes experienced across host lifetimes by smoothing environmental transitions. Our simulations reveal that microbial fitness and host fitness are at odds with each other when considering the impact of vertical inheritance of microbial communities from a host to its offspring-where high parent-offspring microbial transmission favours microbial fitness, while low transmission favours host fitness. These tradeoffs are minimized when microbial generation count per host generation is high. This may arise from 'cross-generational priority effects' which maintain diversity within the community and can subsequently enable selection of beneficial microbes by the host. Our model is extensible into new areas of holobiont research and provides novel insights into holobiont evolution under variable environmental conditions.

Recently, research on the management of Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly non-motor symptoms (NMS), has been increasingly reported. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture interventions for NMS in PD patients to identify the most effective strategy. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on acupuncture for NMS in PD were retrieved up to July 31, 2024, across eight databases: PubMed, Embase (OVID), Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Database, and Wanfang Database. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews. 77 RCTs were included, involving 5538 PD patients. The NMA indicated that acupuncture_training_usual ([SUCRA] = 84.18%) was the best intervention for improving the anxiety state of PD patients. Abdominal_acupuncture_usual (94.15%) was a preferred intervention for improving the depressive state. Scalp_acupuncture_usual (99.98%) and Scalp_electroacupuncture (94.28%) can significantly improve the sleep quality of PD patients. Heat_sensitive_moxibustion_usual (94.65%) and Warm_acupuncture_moxibustion_usual (99.995%) can significantly improve the quality of life of PD patients. Acupuncture_usual (94.02%) may be considered a promising intervention for improving the psychological, emotional and cognitive functions. Additionally, shallow_acupuncture_usual (99.17%) was the safest option. Notably, acupuncture_moxibustion (98.24%) was the most effective intervention involving the largest number of participants. This analysis identifies the most effective acupuncture interventions for improving NMS in PD patients, including anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and overall quality of life, as well as additional benefits in pain management and gastrointestinal function. Future large-scale RCTs are needed to confirm these findings.

Oral health is an important aspect of quality of life for older people, especially those with dementia. The impact of an active oral hygiene program on the oral microbiome was explored in a group of older participants (average age 84 years old) with dementia against a separate control group whose oral hygiene followed the status quo. The oral cavity bacteriomes and mycobiomes were assessed from swabs of cheek, gum, and tongue surfaces. Samples were collected at the beginning and end of a 6-week study period, and bacterial and fungal community profiles were determined by short-read metabarcode sequencing of 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, respectively. The predominant bacteria were found to be in order of abundance: Streptococcus, Cellulosimicrobium, Rothia, Veillonella, Prevotella, Actinomyces, and species that belonged to the families Lactobacillaceae and Gemellaceae. Similarly, common fungal species belonged to Saccharomyces and the Candida-Lodderomyces clade. The intensive oral hygiene program did not affect bacterial or fungal taxa distributions. A minor reduction in bacterial species richness (15%-20%) was observed post-intervention in both groups. Mycobiome outcomes varied by sampling sites, unlike bacterial communities, which were relatively homogenous. Participant differences, potentially individual health status, genetics, and other personal factors, explained most data set variations (70%-78% of the variance), with the experimental design accounting for about 2%. To enable an alteration of oral cavity communities that may improve overall oral health and mitigate infectious disease risks in older people, especially those in residential care, targeted and specific hygiene approaches may be needed for the purposes of assessing effectiveness at the microbiological level. Future research should focus on developing and testing such targeted strategies to mitigate infectious disease risks and enhance the quality of life for older individuals, particularly those in residential care settings.

Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a degenerative joint disease triggered by trauma or intense mechanical stress, leading to joint cartilage degeneration and functional impairment. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) contributes significantly to cartilage degradation following mechanical injury by activating its receptor, Prostaglandin E receptor 4 (EP4), on chondrocyte membranes. The homeostasis of articular cartilage primarily relies on the dynamic balance between cartilage degradation and repair, a process finely regulated by chondrocytes. The Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase II (CAMKII) signaling pathway has been shown to play a critical role in mediating chondrocyte function restoration. In this study, we observed increased expression of EP4, Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), and phosphorylated CaMKII in interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) stimulated chondrocytes, suggesting a possible link between EP4 signaling and calcium dysregulation. However, direct evidence confirming the involvement of the EP4-Ca2+/CaMKII axis in PTOA is still lacking. Further investigations using genetic or pharmacological interventions are needed to clarify this potential mechanism. These findings provide a preliminary basis for exploring calcium homeostasis and EP4 signaling as targets for PTOA treatment.

In breast pathology, p63 is a highly specific myoepithelial marker, crucial for distinguishing in situ from invasive lesions. Its expression is characteristically absent in the neoplastic cells of invasive carcinoma. However, in our diagnostic experience focal p63 expression in neoplastic cells of some high-grade breast tumors has been observed. This study aimed to describe the expression pattern of p63 in high-grade versus low and intermediate-grade invasive breast carcinomas. We performed a retrospective immunohistochemical analysis for p63 on a cohort of 60 breast core biopsies. The cases included 20 Grade 3 (G3), 20 Grade 2 (G2) and 20 Grade 1 (G1) invasive breast carcinomas, graded according the Nottingham grading system. Nuclear p63 expression in neoplastic cells was assessed and described. Positive p63 staining in neoplastic cells was identified in 16 out of 20 (80 %) high-grade invasive carcinomas. The staining pattern was typically focal and moderate in intensity. Conversely, all but one case of invasive breast carcinoma G2 showed absolute negativity for p63. All cases of low-grade invasive carcinoma also showed clear negativity for p63. A clear association between p63 expression in neoplastic cells and G3 grading was observed. Our findings suggest that p63 expression can be a feature of high-grade invasive breast carcinoma. Although this findings represents a potential diagnostic pitfall, especially on small core biopsy samples, the awareness of this possibility can also allow p63 to serve as a helpful ancillary clue for identifying high-grade disease.

This study describes economic burden of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in France, with consideration of disease severity as measured by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. This observational, retrospective study used data from the French National Health Data System. Adults (≥18) with at least one disease related hospitalization during 2012-2018 were included. Patients with less than 1-year follow-up or phenocopy disorders were excluded. Patients were stratified by disease severity class based on disease specific treatments and symptoms. Healthcare resources use, and costs were estimated per patient-year. Annual cost before and after septal reduction therapies was estimated. Overall, 6823 patients were identified (baseline NYHA class I-IV: 4%, 32%, 60%, and 4%, respectively). Mean (standard deviation) follow-up was 4.4 (2.5) years, comprising 30 228 patient-years. Total burden was €388 million (€12 824 per patient-year), and higher NYHA class was associated with higher cost per patient year: €8881 and €22 818 for classes I and IV, respectively. Hospitalizations accounted for most costs (54%); 71% were cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, 46% disease-related. Mean cost per patient-year was lower 1 year before vs after septal reduction therapy, including the intervention (€13 726 vs €18 565). Mean sick-leave-related costs per patient-year were €310, €673, €757, and €774 for classes I-IV, respectively. Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has a high economic burden driven by cardiovascular hospitalizations. Higher disease severity yielded higher costs associated with medical care and sick leave than lower classes. Results support need for new therapies to improve both symptoms and disease severity.

Opioid use disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, altering stress responses depending on the stage of use. A higher cortisol/DHEA-S ratio may indicate relapse risk in substance use disorders. This study aimed to explore differences in serum cortisol/DHEA-S ratio and its association with proximal and perceived stress, social support, and coping strategies in opioid-dependent youth. In this study, we assessed 51 males aged 15-24 with opioid (heroin) use disorder from an Indian treatment center, categorized into three groups: recently admitted patients with opioid use, buprenorphine-maintained patients, and healthy controls (n = 17 each). Serum cortisol and DHEA-S levels were analyzed using ELISA. We found significant differences in cortisol (p < .001), DHEA-S (p < .001), and cortisol/DHEA-S ratio (p < .001) across groups. Recently admitted patients with opioid use had elevated cortisol/DHEA-S ratios (0.37), whereas buprenorphine maintenance with active coping strategies showed reduced ratios (0.22), indicating potential normalization of HPA axis function. Cortisol levels correlated positively with past-year stress in recent users, whereas the cortisol/DHEA-S ratio correlated negatively with social support. These findings suggest that buprenorphine maintenance, combined with effective coping and social support, may help normalize HPA axis imbalance, potentially reducing relapse risk in opioid-dependent youth. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and their implications for treatment strategies.

The study explored HSPiP and QbD-(quality by design) enabled optimized cubosomes for sustained drug release, improved permeation, and enhanced oral bioavailability. OCUB1 (the optimized product) was characterized for size, zeta potential (ZP), thermal analysis, and surface roughness. In vitro drug release and hemolysis studies were carried out using a dialysis membrane and rat erythrocytes (4 % suspension), respectively. An ex vivo non-everted intestinal permeation study (180 min) compared permeation potential between DS (suspension) and OCUB1. In vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) study investigated PK parameters in rats whereas hematological and biochemical assays ensured the safety of OCUB1. HSPiP predicted glyceryl monooleate (GMO), poloxamer-188, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as optimal excipients based on minimum RED (relative energy difference) values while QbD identified OCUB1 as the most optimized formulation with desirable attributes such as low size (169 nm), high ZP (-29.2 mV), low polydispersity index (0.23), and maximum entrapment efficiency (85.3 %). Thermal analysis confirmed solubilization of TOTA in OCUB1, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique confirmed its cubical shape. OCUB1 showed extended drug release (98.1 % over 48 h) and sustained ex vivo permeation (J ss  = 6.69 μg/cm2/min, steady state flux) across rat intestine as compared to DS (J ss  = 9.172 μg/cm2/min). In vivo PK parameters exhibited significant improvement, with 3.2-fold increase in Cmax as compared to the DS. In vitro hemolysis, along with biochemical and hematological assays, ensured the safety of OCUB1 for oral delivery. Conclusively, OCUB1 presents a promised alternative to conventional capsule, offering reduced side effects and enhanced patient compliance.

Karyotype variation within Pacific kangaroo rat Dipodomys agilis motivated its division in 1997 into the agile kangaroo rat (AKR, D. agilis, 2N = 62) in the north of its range in California, and Dulzura kangaroo rat (DKR, D. simulans, 2N = 60) to the south, with a suspected sympatric zone south of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains. This division was supported by our whole genome sequencing that sampled a ~120 km transect from north of the mountains to SW Riverside County. The taxa showed marked genetic differentiation, with no evidence of hybridization or sympatry. AKR was found at the southern edge of the mountains, precluding the mountain barrier driving isolation, suggesting ecological separation linked to habitat differences between the mountains and the arid area to the south. Adding four additional Dipodomys species, we estimated genetic divergence times in the genus back to ∼3.5 mya. AKR and DKR diverged from D. stephensi ∼1.7 mya, and from each other ∼0.5 mya, when their joint effective population size (Ne) was ~100,000. After separation, DKR's Ne declined to ~20,000, while AKR's was little changed. More recently their Ne converged at ~50,000. Runs of homozygosity were longer in AKR, indicating a smaller neighborhood size, which may have promoted the karyotype change; however, nucleotide diversity was higher in AKR, but both had levels typical for rodents, indicating neither experienced recent bottlenecks. These patterns provide a baseline for any future conservation efforts. More generally, this study shows how a detailed genomic study can resolve taxonomic and demographic questions among morphologically indistinguishable taxa.

Intestinal inflammation particularly inflammatory bowel disease poses significant clinical challenges due to its chronic nature, limited treatment efficacy and adverse effects of conventional therapies like corticosteroids and biologics. Biomimetic nanocarriers have emerged as a transformative strategy to overcome these limitations by leveraging natural cell membranes for targeted drug delivery. This review critically examines the application of biomimetic nanocarriers as precision therapeutics for intestinal inflammation. We discuss key fabrication techniques including extrusion, sonication and microfluidics used to coat synthetic nanocarriers with membranes derived from several biological sources such as macrophages, neutrophils, platelets, stem cells and bacteria. These biomimetic coatings exploit inherent biological functions such as immune evasion, receptor-mediated binding to inflamed endothelium and responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Preclinical studies demonstrate that biomimetic nanocarriers effectively suppress pro-inflammatory pathways like NF-κB, NLRP3, sequester cytokines, promote mucosal healing and restore gut microbiota balance while minimizing systemic toxicity. Despite promising outcomes in animal models, clinical translation faces hurdles in membrane isolation standardization, long-term biosafety, and regulatory alignment. Future advancements require interdisciplinary efforts to optimize pharmacokinetics, enhance tissue-specific targeting, and integrate personalized designs. Biomimetic nanocarriers represent a paradigm shift toward disease-modifying therapies, offering potential for sustained remission in intestinal inflammation management.

To compare the efficacy of different settings in continuous-wave transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (CW-TSCPC). Prospective, randomized, triple-blind clinical trial in a single tertiary center. Adult glaucoma patients who need continuous wave-transscleral cyclophotocoagulation to control intraocular pressure (IOP) or prevent or treat ocular pain/discomfort secondary to increased IOP. Group A uses 1 250 mW for 4 seconds. Group B uses 2 000 mW for 2 seconds. IOP, best-corrected visual acuity, glaucoma medication, complications, and the need to retreat. Eighteen and 19 eyes in group A and group B, respectively, were included. Groups were comparable at baseline (p > 0.1) for mean age (76.9, 73.5 years), mean IOP (29.1, 29.8 mm Hg), mean logMAR visual acuity (1.6, 1.7), and mean number of glaucoma agents (3.4, 3.4). IOP was comparable between groups at 1 (15.6, 13.7 mm Hg), 4-6 (14.6, 14.8 mm Hg) and 12 months (10.3, 17.3 mm Hg; p = 0.07). There was a trend toward more medication reduction earlier in group B at 1 and 4-6 months (p = 0.11). Complication rates were similar between groups (group A: n = 6; group B: n = 9), with more serious complications in group B. Reintervention was required in 5 patients in group A, and 3 patients in group B after a mean of 4.7 and 6.7 months, respectively. Both techniques are efficient and comparable in reducing IOP. Our study favours the 1 250 mW for 4 seconds group, with its possibly better safety profile.

The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics and etiology of endometrial hyperemia in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) through two complementary approaches: clinical data analysis to characterize endometrial hyperemia and clinical trials to elucidate its underlying causes. ELISA was employed to quantify inflammatory mediators in endometrial tissue, while reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analyses were conducted to assess the expression levels of molecules associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Additionally, RT-qPCR was used to determine the mRNA expression levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, and EPO. Compared with non-PCOS patients, those with PCOS exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of chronic endometritis (CE) (P < 0.05) along with increased levels of inflammatory factors (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, and EPO, as well as ERS-related molecules, were significantly elevated in PCOS patients (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from CE and that endometrial hyperemia is the primary manifestation of CE in these patients. The results further suggest that endometrial hypoxia-induced ERS may contribute to the development of endometrial hyperemia in PCOS patients.

Ion channels are a type of protein channel that play a vital role in numerous physiological functions by facilitating the passage of ions through cell membranes, thereby enabling ion and electrical signal transmission. As a crucial target for drug action, ion channels have been implicated in various diseases. Many natural products from marine organisms, such as fungi, algae, sponges, and sea cucumber, etc. have been found to have activities related to ion channels for decades. These interesting natural product molecules undoubtedly bring good news for the treatment of neurological and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, 92 marine natural products and their synthetic derivatives with ion channel-related activities that were identified during the period 2000-2024 were systematically reviewed. The synthesis and mechanisms of action of selected compounds were also discussed, aiming to offer insights for the development of drugs targeting ion channels.
40909398	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Cultural narratives, social norms, and psychological stigma: a study of mental health help-seeking behavior in Peshawar, Pakistan.	Mental health stigma remains a major barrier to accessing psychiatric care worldwide, with pronounced effects in culturally traditional societies such as Peshawar, Pakistan. In the Pashtun cultural context, the code of Pashtunwali-an honor-based system-shapes social attitudes and behaviors, potentially influencing mental health help-seeking patterns. This study examines how cultural narratives, social norms, and stigma interact to affect help-seeking behavior in this sociocultural setting. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a stratified random sample of 400 adults aged 19 years and above in Peshawar. Data were collected using culturally validated instruments, including the Mental Illness Stigma Scale (MISS) and a Social Norms Scale. Bivariate analyses employed simple linear regression and binary logistic regression to examine individual relationships between variables. Multivariate analyses, including multiple linear regression and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), were used to assess combined effects and mediation pathways. Cultural narratives had a positive impact on help-seeking behavior, explaining 42% of its variance. Stigma showed a significant negative association, decreasing help-seeking likelihood by 26% for each unit increase. Social norms demonstrated a positive association with help-seeking behavior and indirectly reduced stigma. Collectively, these variables accounted for 68% of the variance in help-seeking likelihood. The findings highlight the pivotal role of culturally resonant narratives and supportive social norms rooted in Pashtunwali in improving mental health service utilization. Addressing stigma while reinforcing positive cultural frameworks can substantially enhance help-seeking behavior in Peshawar and similar sociocultural contexts.

Cerebrovascular ageing is a complex process characterized with increased vessel stiffness, decreased sensitivity to vasodilators and vasoconstrictors, and reduced angiogenesis, which is mediated via time-dependent manner. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, calculated by ln[fasting triglycerides (TG) (mg/dl) × fasting blood glucose (FBG) (mg/dl)/2], has recently been evidenced as a reliable surrogate of insulin resistance (IR). Currently extensive studies provide robust statistical evidence of the predictability of the TyG index in the development and prognosis of ageing-related cerebrovascular diseases. Yet the application of the TyG index in ageing-related cerebrovascular diseases has not been systemically evaluated in clinical practice, and also the underlying shared mechanism has not been disentangled. Therefore, revealing novel treatment strategies and identifying the potential mechanisms targeting the TyG index is of significant importance. On this basis, more studies are warranted to standardize the optimal care taken in clinical referring TyG index, which will benefit patients with high cerebrovascular diseases risk. Here, we searched the Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, PubMed, and other relevant English databases and related websites from inception to August 2025 and reviewed existing literature and describe the current scope and impact of the TyG index on ageing-related cerebrovascular diseases, aiming to highlight its application value and underlying mechanism.

Reproducibility and research integrity are foundational tenets to scientific discovery, which are produced utilizing well-established, proven principles and protocols. Furthermore, with the ever-increasing prevalence and burden cardiovascular disease (CVD) places on individuals and society at large, it deems essential to cultivate robust and validated model for investigation. Our group utilizes a two-surgery protocol in a swine model that has been progressively refined over the last twenty years, in which we first induce chronic myocardial ischemia by placement of an ameroid constrictor mimicking the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease (CAD) in humans. The second and terminal procedure is a comprehensive and thoughtful collection of cardiac hemodynamic parameters as well as regional coronary perfusion, followed by beating heart euthanasia and detailed sectioning of the heart. Our lab uses isotope-labeled microspheres to analyze myocardial blood flow to the ischemic area as a powerful method to quantify collateralization due to experimental therapeutic agents. Furthermore, and likely the most important measurable cardiovascular outcome, we utilize left ventricular pressure-volume (PV) loop catheterization to measure a broad range of hemodynamic parameters. We hope by detailing the comprehensive cardiac analysis of our swine model of chronic myocardial ischemia, other researchers may improve and cultivate their own protocols and therapy investigation for the elimination of cardiovascular disease.

IntroductionObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects 1.1-1.8% of the population, and adult females are more likely to suffer from it. Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) stimulates dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex - two frontal brain networks implicated in OCD. This study aims to identify a biological marker for beta rhythm that correlates with the treatment response works following dTMS.MethodsA total of 56 right-handed treatment-resistant OCD patients (35 female and 21 male) were retrospectively included in the study which were treated with FDA-approved dTMS protocol by using H7-coil for OCD. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used before and after dTMS to determine the severity of OCD symptoms and the responsiveness to therapy. Also, beta oscillations gathered from 19 electrodes quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) was assessed as treatment response prediction while controlling age and sex parameters.ResultsWhen controlling for sex and age, the Y-BOCS decline rate was linked to higher pretreatment beta activity in the parietal and occipital regions. In the second step of our analysis, we used a stepwise linear regression analysis to create a model predicting YBOCS decline rate. In this model, age (beta = -0.284, p = 0.030) and pretreatment beta parietal power band (beta = 0.312, p = 0.018) were the predictors.ConclusionAge and pretreatment parietal beta power bands may be used as a biomarker for predicting response to dTMS therapy if confirmed by further studies.

Lung ultrasonography is being increasingly used in mechanically ventilated patients to evaluate the lung aeration during incremental positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) adjustments and to evaluate the weaning process from mechanical ventilation. The effects of PEEP may vary across different lung pathologies and may not consistently correlate with changes in lung aeration as assessed by lung ultrasound scores (LUSs). To assess the role of lung ultrasonography in evaluating lung aeration during the application of PEEP in mechanically ventilated patients with various lung pathologies. An observational study was conducted over 18 months in a tertiary care hospital. Patients of both genders, aged between 18-75 years, who had been admitted to the intensive care unit, and required mechanical ventilation, were studied. A standard ventilatory strategy was used and incremental levels of PEEP [5, 10, and 15 cm water (H2O)] were applied. Baseline characteristics, including oxygen saturation (SpO2), LUS, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and their changes with incremental PEEP levels, were recorded and analyzed. In this study, 45.9% of patients required a PEEP of 5 cm H2O to achieve the endpoint of lung aeration (LUS of 0). In addition, 86.5% and 13.5% of patients reached the endpoint of lung aeration at PEEP levels of 10 and 15 cm H2O, respectively. The proportion of patients with higher lung scores decreased significantly with increasing PEEP levels (P < 0.001 for 5 and 10 cm H2O and P = 0.032 for 15 cm H2O). SpO2 increased significantly with higher PEEP levels (P < 0.001), confirming the effectiveness of PEEP in improving oxygenation. The results also revealed a significant increase in HR and a decrease in MAP following the application of higher PEEP levels. Increasing PEEP levels in mechanically ventilated patients improves lung aeration, which can be effectively assessed using bedside lung ultrasonography.

The increasing shortage of specialists in ophthalmology and the rising burden on university eye clinics raise questions about the appropriateness of the utilization of university resources. This study investigates the relationship between various sociodemographic determinants, such as age or social status, and the appropriateness of first presentation in a university ophthalmology outpatient clinic. A retrospective analysis was conducted using routine data from 182,170 patients of the university outpatient clinic at the University Medical Center Freiburg (2006-2023). The appropriateness of the first presentation was operationalized by a follow-up visit within 100 days. Social status was assessed using the social index of the City of Freiburg at the postal code level. The data analysis considered relevant covariates such as age, gender, type of consultation, insurance status, distance from residence, and the social index of Freiburg. Of the included patient visits, 42.7% were classified as appropriate. An older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.36 per standard deviation (SD), 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34-1.37) was the strongest predictor of the appropriateness of the presentation. The social index showed a weaker but significant effect (OR 1.05 per SD, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07): a lower social status was associated with increased appropriateness. The distance from residence had no significant influence. The results indicate an association between increased urgency of care and both higher patient age and lower social status, with the latter potentially reflecting care gaps or delayed utilization. The study provides important insights for needs-based resource planning and health policy measures aimed at optimizing ophthalmological care structures.

To identify pregnant women with urinary tract infections who are being monitored at a primary health care unit and their knowledge about antibiotics, as well as facilitating and challenging factors perceived by nurses that influence care, with a focus on antimicrobial resistance. Exploratory, descriptive study with a quantitative approach, involving pregnant women with urinary tract infections undergoing antibiotic treatment at a municipal health unit in São Paulo and nurses working at the same location. Data were obtained from computerized systems, medical records, and interviews, and were synthesized and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and Stata software. Of the 21 pregnant women included, 85.7% had knowledge about antibiotics. Of the 11 participating nurses, 36.4% did not identify the presence of facilitators, but 45.5% believed there were barriers to their care. Most pregnant women had basic knowledge about antibiotics and recognized the importance of guidance from nurses. Nurses identified barriers that point to the need for technical support. Developing a care booklet for nurses who care for pregnant women with urinary tract infections may be a promising strategy to optimize treatment and prevent antimicrobial resistance.

Animal-related injuries remain a neglected public health issue in rural Tanzania, exacerbated by limited access to care and varied occupational exposures. While some studies have examined bite management in tertiary hospitals, little is known about the situation at the primary healthcare (PHC) level. This study explored clinical presentations, management and outcomes of animal-related injuries in a rural Tanzanian setting, using Mkinga District as a case study. A mixed-methods study was conducted in February 2024 across 29 PHC facilities in Mkinga, Tanzania. The quantitative component involved a retrospective audit of animal-related injury records from 2019 to 2023. The qualitative component comprised 10 interviews with facility in-charges to explore clinical decision-making, treatment approaches, and outcomes. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS; thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative transcript. A total of 351 cases were documented. Symptom data were missing in over 70% of records, limiting clinical profiling. Among recorded cases, corticosteroids (55%) and antihistamines (53%) were commonly used, especially for insect and dog bites. Antibiotics were administered in insect stings (26%) and dog bites (23%), and analgesics were frequently used for insect bites. Antidotes were most common in dog (58%) and snake bites (26%). Of two cat bite cases, only one received antibiotics; neither received tetanus toxoid, despite the known infection risk. Qualitative findings highlighted three themes: clinical presentations, treatment modalities, and outcomes. Respondents described primary (e.g., bleeding, pain) and systemic (e.g., respiratory distress, neurological signs) symptoms. Treatment involved a mix of pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and traditional methods. While most patients recovered, some experienced complications or death. PHC facilities manage most animal-related injuries effectively, but gaps in documentation, guideline adherence, and referral systems remain. Strengthening provider training, improving resources, and engaging traditional healers may enhance timely care. Broader surveillance and community education are critical to reducing preventable harm.

It is language specific. To assess the construct validity, intrarater and interrater reliability of the Italian version of the SOS test. Thirty-five pwPD and 15 healthy controls (HC) completed the Italian version of the SOS test. Participants copied an Italian text for 5 min on blank paper using a pen. Two independent raters evaluated writing speed, letter size, and handwriting quality according to the SOS test criteria. Correlations between the Italian SOS test scores, fine motor skills, and PD characteristics were analysed using Spearman's Rho correlation coefficient (ρ). Group comparisons were adjusted for education level using ANCOVA. Intrarater and interrater reliability were calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) or Kendall's Tau (Kτ) coefficient depending on data distribution. The Italian version of the SOS test showed significant correlations between writing speed and fine motor skills in pwPD (ρ = 0.40; p = 0.016). PwPD showed significantly smaller letter size (η2p = 0.15; p = 0.006), lower writing speed (η2p = 0.18; p = 0.002), and lower writing quality (η2p = 0.12; p = 0.015) compared to HC. Intrarater reliability was excellent (ICCs > 0.990 and Kτ > 0.762 for pwPD; ICCs > 0.923 for HC), as was interrater reliability (ICCs > 0.860 and Kτ = 0.999 for pwPD; ICCs > 0.925 for HC).

The role of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with tandem lesions (TL) undergoing endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remains a subject of ongoing debate. The substantial clot burden and the potential need for periprocedural antiplatelet therapy during emergent carotid stenting (CAS) add to the complexity of treatment decisions. This study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze the literature to evaluate the comparative safety and efficacy of IVT plus EVT versus EVT alone in AIS patients with TL. A systematic search was conducted across four databases to identify studies comparing outcomes for patients with TL receiving IVT prior to EVT with those receiving EVT alone. Outcomes of interest included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), functional independence (90-day modified Rankin Scale 0-2), successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3), and 90-day mortality. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) for each outcome and conducted a sensitivity analysis for patients who underwent emergent CAS. The analysis included 24 studies with a total of 3,294 patients: 1,860 (56.5%) received IVT plus EVT, and 1,434 (43.5%) received EVT alone. There was no significant increase in the risk of sICH between the IVT + EVT and EVT alone groups (IVT + EVT: 8.4% vs. EVT alone: 8.8%; OR = 0.90; 95%CI 0.67-1.21; I2 = 5%). The sensitivity analysis showed no significant difference in sICH between patients treated with IVT before emergent CAS and those who received CAS alone (IVT + CAS: 10.6% vs. CAS alone: 10.9%; OR = 0.78; 95%CI 0.44-1.37; I2 = 0%). Patients treated with IVT before EVT had significantly higher odds of functional independence (IVT + EVT: 52.6% vs. EVT alone: 44.1%; OR = 1.34; 95%CI 1.13-1.59; I2 = 2.5%) and successful reperfusion (IVT + EVT: 83.3% vs. EVT alone: 79.8%; OR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.14-1.89; I2 = 14%). Additionally, the IVT + EVT group had lower odds of 90-day mortality (IVT + EVT: 13.4% vs. EVT alone: 21.1%; OR = 0.61; 95%CI 0.47-0.78; I2 = 0%). In conclusion, the current meta-analysis provides supporting evidence indicating that the combination of IVT and EVT does not increase the risk of sICH in patients with TL, even in the context of emergent CAS. Notably, IVT + EVT may offer potential benefits in achieving functional independence, successful reperfusion, and reducing mortality compared to EVT alone. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to validate these findings.

Introduction Malnutrition is a common yet often overlooked issue in hospitalized patients, contributing to increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, and delayed recovery. Early nutritional intervention may help mitigate these risks. Objective This study aims to evaluate the role of early nutritional intervention in preventing in-hospital complications among medical ward patients. Methodology This retrospective observational study was conducted over a 12-month period at Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan, and included 189 adult patients admitted to medical wards. Patients were divided into two groups: an intervention group (n = 95), which received both early nutritional screening (within 48 hours of admission) and at least one form of support (oral supplements, enteral feeding, or dietitian consultation), and a control group (n = 94), which did not receive such interventions. Data on demographics, nutritional status, interventions, and outcomes were collected. Statistical analysis included t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression. Results Early nutritional support significantly reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired infections (12/95; 12.6% vs. 28/94; 29.8%, p = 0.004), pressure ulcers (4/95; 4.2% vs. 15/94; 16.0%, p = 0.009), and delayed wound healing (7/95; 7.4% vs. 19/94; 20.2%, p = 0.015). The intervention group also had a shorter mean hospital stay (7.2 ± 3.1 vs. 9.4 ± 4.6 days, p < 0.001). Logistic regression showed that absence of early nutrition and age > 60 years were independent predictors of complications. Conclusion Early nutritional intervention is linked to reduced complications and shorter hospital stays. Routine nutritional screening with timely support should be integrated into standard inpatient care.

Meningiomas exhibit considerable phenotypic variation within each WHO grade, thus additional markers are needed to identify prognostically relevant subgroups and optimize long-term management. Among biomarkers, genetic signatures correlate with prognoses. High Ki-67 proliferation indices and TERT promotor mutations and loss of CDKNA are known prognostic markers. Yet, such markers were mainly established by correlative analyses between biomarker expression and retrospective clinical data. Our group has reported on expression of a panel of markers in 176 meningiomas from 170 meningioma patients who underwent surgery from 2005 to 2008 in a previous publication. The markers were growth hormone receptor, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, progesterone receptor (PR), CD34, androgen receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor E30, caspase 3, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Of the 176 meningiomas, 159 were classified as WHO grade 1, 16 were WHO grade 2 and one was WHO grade 3. We have now surveyed outcome after >10 years. We analyzed possible correlations between marker expression and clinical data such as recurrence, tumor location and patient death. 27 of 155 WHO grade 1 and 5 of 15 WHO grade 2 meningiomas recurred. No statistically significant correlations between marker expression and recurrence were observed. The 10-year mortality was 10,8% and 53,4% for WHO grade 1 and 2, respectively, with 47 % and 50 % being disease specific for meningioma. A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between PR expression and death related to the tumor (50 % PR expression vs. 89 % in those not dying from the tumor; p = 0.001). Additionally, Ki-67 values showed to be higher in tumors of patients dying from the tumor (8 % vs. 4 %, p = 0.001). A statistically significant relationship was observed between PR and central/skull base (70 % expression in central/skull base vs. 39 % in other locations, p = 0,0002). During 10-year follow-up, tumor recurrence was an important cause of death, accounting for approximately half of follow-up mortality despite the benign grading of meningiomas. This ambitious, prospective observational study failed to identify expression of GHr, Igf1r, CD34, EGFR, caspase 3 and VEGF as clinically relevant biomarkers.

Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) endures as a substantial impediment to the management of cardiovascular disease. The pathophysiology of MIRI is complex, involving oxidative stress, calcium overload, inflammation, and apoptosis. The NRG1/ErbB4 signaling pathway has been implicated in modulating oxidative stress responses in the heart, potentially reducing cellular damage caused by free radicals. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the NRG1/ErbB4 pathway confers protection in a rat model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MIRI) injury. A rat MIRI model was established, involving 30 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats randomly assigned to five groups: control, sham operation, MIRI, recombinant NRG1, and AG1478. NRG1 concentrations in heart tissues were measured by ELISA, while p-ErbB4 and total ErbB4 protein levels were assessed by Western blot. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were evaluated by flow cytometry.In the MIRI group, NRG1 levels were significantly reduced compared to the control and sham operation groups (p < 0.05). Recombinant NRG1 treatment led to a marked increase in NRG1 levels in heart tissue, along with an enhanced p-ErbB4/ErbB4 expression ratio (p < 0.05). The AG1478 group exhibited lower NRG1 levels and a reduced p-ErbB4/ErbB4 ratio compared to the recombinant NRG1 group (p < 0.05). In terms of apoptosis and ROS levels, the MIRI group showed significantly higher rates than the control and sham operation groups (p < 0.05). Recombinant NRG1 treatment significantly reduced myocardial cell apoptosis and ROS levels (p < 0.05), while AG1478 also attenuated these effects, but to a lesser extent. The NRG1/ErbB4 signaling pathway plays a pivotal protective role in MIRI in rats. Supplementation with exogenous NRG1 effectively elevates NRG1 levels in the heart, activates the ErbB4 signaling pathway, reduces myocardial cell apoptosis, and decreases ROS levels, thereby mitigating MIRI-induced damage.

Post-thoracotomy pain (PTP) is a challenging complication following thoracic surgery, often leading to chronic, debilitating symptoms. However, little is known about the potential of intraoperative cryoneurolysis (IC) as a solution for managing PTP. This retrospective case series reports the application of IC in three patients undergoing thoracic surgery for chest wall tumors. Under direct visualisation of the intercostal nerves, temporary inhibition of nerve signalling was achieved without disrupting the surrounding tissue using a handheld device. All three patients experienced decreased pain and reduced reliance on opioids during the 6 week postoperative period. These outcomes highlight the potential of IC to improve post-thoracotomy pain management.

Vocal fold (VF) polyps are among the most common minimal associated pathological lesions (MAPLs), typically resulting from voice misuse or abuse. Clinically, they present with dysphonia and may be accompanied by vocal fatigue. VF polyps can be classified histologically into hemorrhagic (telangiectatic), fibrous, mixed, or hyaline types. Hemorrhagic polyps, in particular, are often acute in onset and typically appear reddish during laryngeal examination due to their rich vascularity. While surgical excision has traditionally been the standard treatment, conservative approaches-such as vocal hygiene advice (VHA) and voice therapy (VT)-have emerged as viable alternatives, particularly for small-sized polyps. However, the influence of polyp size on the efficacy of these nonsurgical treatments remains unclear and warrants further investigation. This retrospective observational study was conducted on 35 patients at a tertiary care hospital to evaluate the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches for hemorrhagic vocal fold polyps. A comprehensive chart review was undertaken, encompassing patient demographics, occupational voice use, vocal symptoms (including vocal fatigue), pre- and post-treatment laryngeal imaging, treatment modalities, and follow-up outcomes. Patients were classified into three groups based on the intervention received: VHA alone, a combination of VHA and VT, and surgical intervention. The primary outcome was the change in polyp size following treatment, used as an indicator of the effectiveness of nonsurgical approaches (VHA with or without VT) in resolving hemorrhagic polyps of varying sizes. Reduction in polyp size was assessed 4-6weeks after therapy. Laryngeal images were analyzed to document size variations visually. Statistical analyses were conducted to explore associations between initial polyp size and treatment efficacy, as well as the impact of demographic and clinical variables on outcomes. 85.7% of the studied sample showed improvement. Surgery had a 100% success rate, whereas VHA alone had the lowest improvement rate (66.7%). VHA + VT resulted in higher improvement rates (76.9%) compared to VHA alone. Smaller polyps showed better outcomes with conservative management. No statistically significant factors were identified, possibly due to the small sample size except for smoking that was significantly associated with poorer treatment outcomes. While surgery remains the most effective treatment, VHA + VT offers a viable conservative approach, particularly for smaller polyps. It is advised to combine VT with VHA as VHA alone appears to be the least effective. Further research with a larger sample size is recommended to confirm these findings.

Lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (LA-HLH) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome, and hierarchical management based on a prognostic model is important. The endothelial activation and stress index (EASIX) score has demonstrated prognostic utility in recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. However, its role in LA-HLH remains unestablished. We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with LA-HLH from 28 medical centers to explore the prognostic impacts of EASIX in LA-HLH. EASIX was calculated using baseline lactate dehydrogenase, serum creatinine, and platelet counts. A total of 490 patients with LA-HLH were included and stratified by EASIX quartiles (Q1-Q4). Patients with a higher EASIX score had significantly inferior 2-month survival and overall survival, according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses, after adjustment for age, gender, lymphoma type, splenomegaly, bone marrow infiltration, lymphoma status (treatment-naïve versus relapsed/refractory), hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count, serum ferritin levels, and aspartate aminotransferase, the highest EASIX quartile (Q4) exhibited a 7.01-fold risk of death compared to the lowest quartile (Q1) (Hazard ratio [HR] = 7.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.98-12.36; p < 0.001). Additionally, the restricted cubic splines (RCS) analysis illustrated an increase in the risk of mortality with an increasing EASIX score. Our findings support EASIX being a robust, universally accessible prognostic marker for LA-HLH, strongly associated with early mortality risk. This index can be used to stratify the risk levels of patients with LA-HLH and predict their survival outcomes.

Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy in suppressing plasma viremia in people living with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), persistent viral RNA expression in tissue reservoirs is observed and can contribute to HIV-1-induced immunopathology and comorbidities. Infection of long-lived innate immune cells, such as tissue-resident macrophages and microglia may contribute to persistent viral RNA production and chronic inflammation. We recently reported that de novo cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 intron-containing RNA (icRNA) in macrophages and microglia leads to MDA5 and MAVS-dependent innate immune sensing and induction of type I IFN responses, demonstrating that HIV icRNA is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). In this report, we show that cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 icRNA also induces NLRP1 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages and microglia in an RLR- and endosomal TLR-independent manner. Infection of both macrophages and microglia with either replication-competent or single-cycle HIV-1 induced IL-1β secretion, which was attenuated when cytoplasmic expression of viral icRNA was prevented. While IL-1β secretion was blocked by treatment with caspase-1 inhibitors or knockdown of NLRP1 or caspase-1 expression in HIV-infected macrophages, overexpression of NLRP1 significantly enhanced IL-1β secretion in an HIV-icRNA-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed interaction of HIV-1 icRNA, but not multiply-spliced HIV-1 RNA, with NLRP1, suggesting that HIV-1 icRNA sensing by NLRP1 is sufficient to trigger inflammasome activation. Together, these findings reveal a pathway of NLRP1 inflammasome activation induced by de novo expressed HIV icRNA in HIV-infected myeloid cells.

Despite growing evidence supporting the mental health benefits of physical activity (PA), the nature of its relationship with anxiety symptoms remains uncertain in student populations. This study aimed to investigate differences in mean scores on the Zung Anxiety Scale among groups of students with different levels of PA and to determine whether there is a dose-response relationship between PA and anxiety symptoms, taking into account various sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and study year. Cross-sectional data were collected from 1,266 fifth-year medical students at five Serbian universities during two academic years. PA was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and categorized into three MET-min/week groups: <600, 601-6,000, and >6,000. Anxiety symptoms were measured using the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for anxiety by PA category, accounting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Students engaging in 601-6,000 MET-min/week of PA were less likely to report anxiety symptoms compared to those engaging in less than 600 MET-min/week. No additional benefit was observed among participants exceeding 6,000 MET-min/week, suggesting a plateau effect. Compared to students in the <600 MET-min/week group, those in the 601-6,000 MET-min/week group were less likely to study in Novi Sad and reported an average or good self-rated financial status, but were more likely to consume alcohol. Participants in the >6,000 MET-min/week group were more likely to be male and belong to the 2023-2024 academic year, and less likely to report an average financial status compared to their peers in the <600 MET-min/week group. Female sex was negatively associated with being in the >6,000 MET-min/week group compared to the 601-6,000 MET-min/week group. The most significant protective benefits against anxiety symptoms were seen in individuals who participated in PA for 601 to 6,000 MET-minutes per week. No additional benefits were observed for PA levels exceeding 6,000 MET-minutes, suggesting a potential plateau effect. These findings emphasize the importance of promoting sustainable PA habits among students. Future research is needed to establish causality and examine the underlying psychophysiological mechanisms in the relationship between PA and mental health.
40894481	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Case Reports;Journal Article	Case Report: Sudden cardiac death due to spasm of multiple coronary arteries.	Diffuse coronary artery spasm (DMV-CAS) is a serious vascular condition characterized by prolonged narrowing of two or more major coronary arteries or their main branches, leading to significant stenosis or blockage (≥70%). This can result in myocardial ischemia, heart attacks, and dangerous arrhythmias. A 68-year-old male with a four-year history of recurrent angina presented with acute-onset chest tightness, palpitations, and syncope. During transport, the patient experienced prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest, with transient return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) achieved in the emergency department. Electrocardiographic evaluation revealed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, pathological Q waves in the inferior, anterior, and anterior septal territories, along with dynamic ST-T abnormalities, including ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and V1-6, and ST depression in leads I and aVL. Emergent coronary angiography identified critical multivessel stenoses, with the most significant narrowing observed in the left anterior descending artery. The diagnosis of DMV-CAS was corroborated through angiographic evidence, demonstrating resolution of the spasm following the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin (200 μg administered bilaterally to the coronary arteries). Despite the implementation of targeted vasodilator therapy, the patient progressed to refractory cardiogenic shock and succumbed in the intensive care unit 1 h after the procedure. This case underscores the rare and severe cardiovascular implications of DMV-CAS, emphasizing the critical need for early and accurate diagnosis of DMV-CAS and the necessity for standardized pharmacological intervention.

A flat control law is based on the structural analysis of a controlled system, allowing optimal placement of sensors and actuators. Once designed, any desired dynamics can be imposed onto the system. When the target dynamics comes from a system structurally different from the controlled one, generalized synchronization can be achieved, provided the control gain is sufficiently large. As the gain increases, various relationships emerge between the drive and response systems, depending on differences in their dimensions and dissipation rates. The principal contribution of this work lies in the exploration of drive-response system pairs with varying dimensions (ranging from 2 to 4) and dissipation levels, including combinations of dissipative and conservative systems. We identify several types of generalized synchronization, using a classification based on the thickness of the resulting Lissajous curves and the lack of conjugacy between the first-return maps of the drive and response systems.

In the phase 3 FRESCO-2 study, fruquintinib plus best supportive care (BSC) significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus placebo plus BSC in patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We present the results of a FRESCO-2 post hoc subgroup analysis evaluating outcomes of patients enrolled in Japan. In FRESCO-2, patients had previously received all standard chemotherapies, anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR therapies if indicated, and had progressed on, or were intolerant to trifluridine-tipiracil and/or regorafenib. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive fruquintinib 5 mg or matching placebo by mouth once daily on days 1-21 in 28-day cycles, plus BSC. The primary endpoint was OS; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Of the 56 patients enrolled in Japan, 40 (71.4%) and 16 (28.6%) were randomized to fruquintinib and placebo, respectively. OS was improved with fruquintinib versus placebo (median 6.9 vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19 - 0.92). PFS was also improved with fruquintinib versus placebo (median 3.6 vs. 1.8 months; HR, 0.27; 95% CI 0.13 - 0.56). The incidence of grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with fruquintinib versus placebo was 71.8% versus 29.4%; the most common grade ≥ 3 TEAEs with fruquintinib were hypertension (23.1%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (17.9%). Fruquintinib improved OS and PFS versus placebo in FRESCO-2 patients enrolled in Japan and demonstrated a manageable safety profile. Results from the Japan subgroup were consistent with the global FRESCO-2 population, thus supporting fruquintinib as a novel treatment option for patients in Japan with refractory mCRC.

To review musculoskeletal disabilities and rehabilitation in adults with thalidomide embryopathy (TE), the authors reviewed the literature related to musculoskeletal disability, quality of life (QOL) and rehabilitation intervention in adults with TE, obtained through a PubMed search, and their experience in clinical practice with Japanese individuals. Through literature search, 25 studies were included for this review. Literature search results and the authors' experiences revealed that, in adults with TE, upper limb disabilities included neuropathy, mainly due to carpal tunnel syndrome; finger pain due to tenosynovitis; and symptoms caused by osteoarthritis, mainly in the shoulders. Disabilities of the trunk and spine included lower back and neck pain. Although disabilities in the lower limbs were uncommon, pain due to hip and knee osteoarthritis were reported. Regarding the health-related QOL in adults with TE, the physical domain of QOL was reduced, which may be related to musculoskeletal disabilities. Reports on rehabilitation approaches for secondary musculoskeletal disabilities in TE, including physical therapy, environmental modification, and alternative medicine, were scarce. This review of musculoskeletal disabilities and QOL in adults with TE revealed that pain is common in the upper limbs and spine, and is associated with reduced physical QOL.

Tropical rainforests support critical biogeochemical cycles regulated by complex plant-soil microbial interactions but are threatened by global change. Much of the uniquely biodiverse and carbon rich forest on Borneo has been lost through extensive conversion to monoculture plantation, and a significant proportion of the remaining forest has been heavily modified by selective logging. Ecological restoration of tropical forest aims to return forests to a near pristine state, but restoration initiatives are hindered by limited understanding of the underpinning plant-soil feedbacks, and impacts on soil microbial communities are unresolved. We characterized soil properties and soil bacterial and fungal communities using amplicon sequencing across adjacent old-growth and selectively logged lowland dipterocarp forest in Borneo undergoing either natural regeneration or restoration by enrichment planting. While many soil properties were similar across forest types, we found contrasting responses of different soil microbial groups to active and passive restoration. Bacterial and fungal community composition were generally distinct in old-growth forest and more similar in logged forest. Bacterial alpha diversity and rate of spatial turnover appeared to recover toward old-growth forest with active restoration, while fungal alpha diversity showed slower signs of recovery. The composition and rate of spatial turnover in mycorrhizal communities was most different between old-growth and actively restored forest, possibly resulting from mycorrhizal associations of tree species planted during restoration. Surprisingly, old-growth forest shared fewer microbial taxa with actively restored forest than with naturally regenerating forest, suggesting current restoration practices (removal of lianas and understorey vegetation) may be selecting for different microbial communities. Taken together, our findings show that certain attributes of key soil microbial groups remain distinct from old-growth forest almost two decades after logging disturbance, and some may diverge with active restoration. Changes in enrichment planting practices to promote rehabilitation of belowground communities may be required for successful biodiversity conservation and recovery of vital ecosystem functions.

This study aims to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Symmed radiofrequency (RF)-based device (Termosalud Inc., Gijón, Spain) in body contouring and skin appearance improvement treatments for abdomen/flanks. Eight sessions of Symmed RF were performed in 15 volunteers' abdomen/flanks. Sessions were conducted every 72/96 h. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the device, photographs, body contours, and ultrasound scans of dermal echogenicity, and adipose tissue thickness were taken at baseline and after the treatments. Additionally, a blind evaluation of the photographic results was conducted. Data regarding the satisfaction level of the participants was also obtained through a customized survey. At the follow-up visit, significant reductions of 2% in body circumference and 9% in fat thickness were detected in the abdomen/flanks. These effects were accompanied by a significant 12% increase in dermal echogenicity, related to skin collagen content and organization. Furthermore, the blind evaluation of the photographic results revealed an overall visual improvement. A high satisfaction level was reported by the participants and no severe adverse events were detected. Symmed treatment is a noninvasive procedure treating skin laxity and reducing abdomen/flanks circumferences safely and effectively. This clinical trial is not registered in a publicly accessible database, and no clinical trial registration number is available. At the time of the investigation, the intended use for fat reduction through radiofrequency was not classified as a medical application under European legislation (COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/42/EEC). In accordance with Spanish and European regulations, only clinical trials evaluating medical devices are required to be registered.

"The lack of a clear and unified definition of shared decision-making (SDM) may hinder its effective application in oncology care. This study aims to clarify the concept of SDM specifically in the context of early-stage breast cancer treatment through an evolutionary concept analysis. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases for articles published from January 2015 to December 2024. Using keywords ""shared decision-making"" and ""breast cancer,"" relevant studies were identified, and key attributes of SDM were extracted and synthesized. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. SDM for early-stage breast cancer treatment was characterized by 10 attributes spanning three levels: 1) Patient perspective: involvement in decision-making, values and preferences regarding treatment options, and deliberative thinking to achieve choice certainty; 2) Healthcare professional perspective: provision of individualized information, psychological support, consultation focused on patients' best interests, collaborative partnerships with patients, coordinated care delivery, and promotion of person-centered, informed choices; 3) Healthcare system level: fostering a patient-centered healthcare culture. These findings provide a comprehensive conceptual framework to guide the development of detailed SDM guidelines tailored for early-stage breast cancer patients. Enhanced understanding of SDM can support nurses and healthcare professionals in facilitating collaborative and optimal decision-making processes within oncology care. Furthermore, this study lays the groundwork for developing measurement tools and disease-specific interventions to advance SDM implementation in early-stage breast cancer treatment.

Epilepsy is a common chronic nervous system disease that threatens human health. However, the role of FOXC1 and its relations with pyroptosis have not been fully studied in epilepsy. Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained for constructing temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) models. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with Mg2+-free medium for inducing in vitro cell models. H&E, TIMM, and Nissl staining were employed for histological evaluation. Flow cytometry was used for measuring cell pyroptosis. ELISA was implemented for detecting the levels of inflammatory cytokines. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed to determine the expression and distribution of genes. ChIP, RIP, MeRIP, and dual-luciferase reporter analysis were performed to investigate the intermolecular interactions. The mRNA and protein level expression of genes were examined using RT-qPCR and western blotting. FOXC1 was lowly expressed in hippocampus tissue of TLE rats, and overexpression of FOXC1 alleviated neuronal damage. Overexpression of FOXC1 downregulated the levels of NLRP3, caspase 1, as well as IL-1β and IL-18 by inhibiting NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in Mg2+-free-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, FOXC1 bound to the promoter of NLRP3 and inhibited NLRP3 transcription. FOXC1 was found to be regulated by the METTL3/YTHDF1 axis-mediated m6A methylation. Overexpression of METTL3 attenuated Mg2+-free-induced neuronal injury and pyroptosis through YTHDF1-dependent regulation of FOXC1. Collectively, these data confirmed that FOXC1 suppressed neuronal injury and pyroptosis in epilepsy by transcriptionally inhibiting NLRP3, which might be correlated to METTL3/YTHDF1 axis-mediated m6A methylation.

The United States opioid epidemic's reach is expanding. Rapidly scaling opioid education and naloxone distribution (OEND) programs is essential within a multipronged public health response. Universities offer infrastructure with potential to support routine, widespread OEND implementation among adolescents and young adults nationally, a priority population who could disseminate to broader networks and geographic communities. This important setting is underutilized, and critical gaps remain in understanding university-based OEND program adoption/implementation. We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews (n=21) among a purposively selected national sample of college health administrators to understand their perceptions of barriers/facilitators of implementing OEND programs at their universities and among universities nationally. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guided data collection and inductive-deductive thematic analysis. Regarding Relative Priority (Inner Setting), High/Mid-Level Leaders (Individuals), and Rationale for the Intervention (emergent code in the Innovation domain), participants described the need for compelling justification to adopt, implement, and prioritize university-based OEND programs. The key justification for administration was student opioid overdose and mortality events. Absent these events and regarding Assessing Needs (Implementation Process), participants described the need for student opioid misuse data to justify investment. Regarding Local Conditions (Outer Setting) and Tension for Change (Inner Setting), participants indicated that a university's level of community obligation and integration determined which opioid overdoses and misuse data administration deemed relevant to justify adoption. Regarding Partnerships & Connections (Outer Setting), Relational Connections (Inner Setting); Planning, Engaging, and Teaming (Implementation Process), participants described external/internal collaborators' key roles in OEND program adoption/implementation. Regarding Local Attitudes (Outer Setting), participants described the need to manage political risk, implicating stigma against harm reduction programming. Regarding Culture and Available Resources (Inner Setting), participants illustrated a trajectory in which their institutions prioritized recovery programming for years before prioritizing harm reduction programming (e.g., OEND programs). Our findings underscore the complexity of university-based OEND program implementation while providing actionable insights to support its national scale-up. Building on identified distinctions between non-implementing and implementing universities, future research should establish OEND programming implementation phase among universities nationally, advance understanding of implementation determinants and strategies distinguishing each phase, and establish core components and best practices.

We report an electro-enhanced catalytic etching approach for direct atomic-level patterning of single-crystal 4H-SiC (0001) surfaces. The process utilizes platinum-coated probes under a negative sample bias, which enhances catalytic reactions and promotes etching of SiC without additional mechanical load. Unlike traditional etching approaches that rely on hazardous chemicals such as hydrofluoric acid, this approach operates under ambient conditions, offering improved safety and environmental compatibility. High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy images reveal that the etched regions retain the perfect crystallographic order down to the outermost atomic layer, with no detectable subsurface damage. The electro-enhanced catalytic etching approach demonstrated here could be extended to fabrication of other semiconductor materials, driving advancements in microelectronics, quantum information, and integrated optoelectronics.

To determine the real-world incidence and predictive factors for venous and arterial thromboembolic events (VTE/AT) in ovarian cancer patients treated with poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (iPARP). A multicenter retrospective study involving 329 ovarian cancer patients who initiated iPARP treatment between January 2015 and December 2022. The primary outcome was the incidence of VTE/AT. Secondary outcomes included predictive factors for thrombosis and the impact of thrombosis on overall survival (OS). Data were analyzed using logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The incidence of VTE/AT was 4.9% (16/329). BRCA2 mutations were significantly more prevalent among patients who developed VTE/AT (56.3% vs. 19.2%; p < 0.001). Combined treatment with bevacizumab was significantly associated with a decreased risk of thrombosis (OR: 0.262; 95% CI: 0.095-0.724; p = 0.010). No statistically significant differences were observed in the median OS between patients who experienced VTE/ATE (63 months) and those who did not (47 months), with a p value of 0.876. BRCA2 mutations could be a significant predictor for VTE/AT among ovarian cancer patients treated with iPARP. Concomitant treatment with bevacizumab may offer protection against thrombotic events, although a concomitant bias cannot be ruled out. These findings may be of interest when designing future clinical trials in the field of thromboprophylaxis.

To compare the outcomes of vestibular schwannoma surgeries over the past decade, focusing on surgical approach, facial nerve function, tumor recurrence, and to standardize a classification system for the extent of tumor resection. A retrospective cohort study involving 197 patients who underwent vestibular schwannoma surgery between January 2014 and December 2023. Data on demographics, tumor characteristics, surgical approach, and facial nerve function were collected. Facial nerve function was monitored intraoperatively, and facial palsy was graded using the House-Brackmann scale. Postoperative MRI was used to assess residual tumor and guide follow-up care. Tumor volumes (preoperative and postoperative) were estimated by measuring the largest diameters in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes A new classification for the extent of tumor resection was proposed, incorporating both the surgeon's intraoperative impression and post-surgery MRI results. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.25. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Of the 197 patients, 84.8% had total resection, and 15.2% had non-total resections. Non-total resections were associated with better facial nerve outcomes. Tumor regrowth occurred in 6 patients (3%). Statistical analysis showed that the extent of resection (p = 0.004), preoperative tumor volume (p = 0.018), and year of surgery (p = 0.005) were significant predictors of facial paralysis. Our policy remains focused on total tumor resection; however, when the tumor is attached to the facial nerve, we advocate for a non-total resection to preserve the integrity of the facial nerve. Based on our study, this approach does not increase the risk of tumor recurrence or the need for revision surgeries in our population.

To determine the long-term risk of osteoarthritis following combined anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and lateral extra-articular procedures (LEAP). A comprehensive search of multiple databases (EMBASE, OVID Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus) was independently conducted by two reviewers according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Studies reporting on the rates of osteoarthritis following primary, arthroscopic ACLR combined with LEAP and a minimum 5-year follow-up were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was the prevalence of moderate to severe radiographic arthritis defined as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grades C or D, Ahlback grades 1-5, or Kellgren-Lawrence grades 3 or 4. A comparative meta-analysis of ACLR with and without LEAP was also performed. A total of eight studies were included, comprising 849 patients who underwent ACLR with LEAP, and 164 who underwent isolated ACLR. Cumulative meta-analysis showed a 4% prevalence of moderate to severe osteoarthritis across all studies after ACLR with LEAP. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a prevalence of 3% in the 5-to-10-year follow-up group and 6% in the 10+ year follow-up group. In the three comparative cohort studies, meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in moderate to severe osteoarthritis rates between ACLR with LEAP and ACLR alone. This study demonstrates that long-term prevalence of moderate to severe osteoarthritis following combined ACLR with LEAP is low, and that the addition of LEAP does not increase the incidence compared to ACLR alone. These findings support the use of LEAP in selected patients, without concern for increased long-term joint degeneration. Level III, meta-analysis and systematic review.

GFRα1 and Ret are the two necessary components of the receptor for GDNF, a neurotrophic factor discovered in the early 1990's for its ability to support the survival of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, including those in the substantia nigra (SN) that project to the dorsal striatum (dSTR) and degenerate in Parkinson's Disease. Several GDNF clinical trials have been conducted to date with mixed results. Despite the physiological and clinical importance of this signaling system, whether any of its components are required for the maintenance of adult SN neurons has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we first analyzed postnatal expression patterns of Gfrα1 and Ret in the SN and established that mRNA levels peak at mouse postnatal day 15 (P15), stabilizing after P30. Using Tamoxifen-induced deletion of Gfrα1 at 3 months of age, we found that GFRα1 is required for the maintenance of a subset of adult SN dopaminergic neurons. FluoroGold tracing of SN axons from the dSTR in mutant mice revealed that ablation of GFRα1 preferentially affects the subset of GFRα1-expressing neurons that project to the STR. In addition to the well-known neuroprotective functions of GDNF/GFRα1/RET signaling, our results establish a physiological requirement of the GFRα1 component of this neurotrophic system for the continuous maintenance of SN dopaminergic neurons in the adult brain.

In 2018, Rwanda incorporated oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada) into national HIV guidelines as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention programme for female sex workers (FSWs). This study assessed the impact of PrEP on HIV incidence among FSWs in urban Rwanda. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among HIV-negative FSWs aged≥18 years at 20 health facilities in Kigali from January 2019 to October 2021. All participants received standard HIV prevention services including routine condom distribution, peer education activities and the option to receive daily oral PrEP. Those who consented to receive PrEP formed the exposed group and those who declined or were not eligible to receive PrEP formed the control group. We used Cox regression to assess HIV seroconversion and logistic regression to assess retention in care. Among 1897 FSWs (median age 30.1 years, IQR: 25.2-35.6), 1129 (59.5%) initiated PrEP. The HIV incidence rate was 0.40 per 100 person-years (PYs) among FSWs in the PrEP group versus 1.83 per 100 PYs for those in the non-PrEP group. In multivariate analysis, PrEP was associated with a reduced risk of HIV seroconversion (adjusted HR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.71). Retention in the HIV prevention programme at 12 months was 77.6% among FSW who used PrEP versus 73.6% among non-users (adjusted OR: 1.29 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.60). Oral PrEP was associated with reduced HIV risk of HIV seroconversion among FSWs in Kigali. However, the small number of HIV seroconversions and limitations of the observational design warrant cautious interpretation of study findings.

The wrentit (Chamaea fasciata) is a chaparral and scrub specialist bird found from coastal Oregon to northern Baja California. We generated a draft reference assembly for the species using PacBio HiFi long read and Omni-C chromatin-proximity sequencing data as part of the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP). Sequenced reads were assembled into 1342 scaffolds totaling 1.19 Gb in length. A contig N50 of 4.5 Mb, scaffold N50 of 73.3 Mb, and BUSCO completeness score of 96.8% indicate that the wrentit genome is a highly contiguous assembly in line with other high quality avian assemblies. An annotation of the assembly identified 16 821 protein-coding genes. We detected a translocation between chromosome 4A of the zebra finch to the Z chromosome of the wrentit. This translocation has previously been identified as a neo-sex chromosome shared across the superfamily Sylvioidea. Finally, we found a negative correlation between transposable element richness and gene density across the genome, but a positive relationship between GC content and gene density. This reference will serve as an essential resource for studies on the biogeography, local adaptation, and conservation genetics of this iconic species of California's chaparral.

Although Kasai surgery has saved many patients with biliary atresia, the long-term survival rate remains low. Recently, cell therapy has been explored as a potential strategy to improve post-surgical survival. This study aims to evaluate the safety and outcomes of allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) infusion in management of liver cirrhosis due to Biliary Atresia after Kasai Operation. A matched case-control study was conducted from April 2019 to May 2023, including 32 patients with the cirrhosis after Kasai portoenterostomy for biliary atresia. Sixteen patients in the cell therapy (CT) group, who received a single hepatic-artery infusion of UC-MSC plus standard care after a modified Kasai procedure at a median age of 9.0 ± 2.1 months (median 9.1, range 6.1-13). Sixteen matched controls underwent the same Kasai technique but received standard care only. Matching required the age at Kasai to differ by no more than 14 days (81.5 days [58 -103] in the therapy group vs 76.0 days [52 -112] in controls; p = 0.77) and that stool-color scores on the Stool Color Card (Taiwan Infant Stool Color Card) be identical. At enrollment the groups were comparable for age (9.0 ± 2.1 vs 9.4 ± 5.2 months; p = 0.52) and PELD score (2.31 ± 4.16 vs 2.69 ± 4.09; p = 0.80). No severe adverse events related to cell therapy were observed. Over 12 months, the CT group showed significantly better biochemical profiles than controls: serum albumin 3.9 ± 0.3 vs. 3.5 ± 0.4 g/dL (p = 0.02), total bilirubin 9 ± 3 vs. 30 ± 10 μmol/dL (p = 0.04) and greater improvement in alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.03). Reductions in AST, ALT and GGT also favored the UC-MSC group but did not reach statistical significance. The CT group demonstrated a significant improvement in disease severity, with PELD scores decreased to -3.56 in the UC-MSC group and 1.64 in the control group (p < 0.01). Allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell administration was safe and may help preserve or improve liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis due to biliary atresia.

The static and dynamic properties of a cyclic Rouse chain modified by the introduction of an effective, spherically symmetric, attracting potential of entropic nature are studied. It is shown that a relatively weak potential can lead to a strong contraction of the polymer chain: the radius of gyration becomes much smaller compared to the size of the free cyclic chain. The pronounced decrease in the terminal relaxation time of cyclic macromolecules in the presence of a harmonic potential compared to the Rouse relaxation time leads to a lengthening of the time interval for the transition to the normal, i.e., the Fickian, diffusion regime, generating a quasi-plateau at increasing molecular mass for the time dependence of segmental mean squared displacement.

Alopecia universalis (AU) is the most severe form of alopecia areata (AA), characterized by complete scalp and body hair loss. While post-COVID-19 hair loss is often attributed to telogen effluvium (TE), emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 may also trigger AU through immune dysregulation, particularly via interferon-gamma (IFN-&gamma;)-mediated inflammation. The chronic and relapsing nature of AU raises challenges in long-term disease management, particularly regarding treatment duration and relapse prevention. We present a 79-year-old woman with no personal or family history of hair loss who developed sudden-onset AU one month after recovering from COVID-19. Initial treatment with topical and intralesional corticosteroids failed, prompting systemic therapy initiation. Over 10 months of treatment, she achieved significant hair regrowth. However, 3 months after discontinuation, hair loss recurred, reinforcing the relapsing nature of post-COVID-19 AU. This case uniquely demonstrates the rapid onset and relapsing nature of post-COVID-19 AU, distinguishing it from idiopathic AU and emphasizing the need for modified long-term treatment strategies. While Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and other immunomodulatory therapies show promise, the risk of relapse upon treatment discontinuation highlights the need for further research into long-term management strategies and maintenance therapy in post-viral AU.

"Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women worldwide. This study aimed to explore the planned behavior of breast self-examination (BSE) and its predictors among women in Northern Iran. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 240 women in Babol, Iran, from 2020 to 2022. Data were collected using BSE barriers, knowledge and practice of BSE, and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) questionnaires. Data were analyzed using a linear regression model and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The mean TPB construct score was 53.2 ± 3.9. The majority of women did not perform the BSE correctly (91.2%), and over half of the women lacked knowledge about BC and timely detection methods (54.6%). There was a significant positive correlation between attitude and ""Do not know how to do it"" (r = 0.160, P = 0.01), and a negative correlation with the marriage age (r = -0.210, P = 0.001), while a significant negative correlation was found between behavioral intention and ''fear of biopsy'' as a barrier (r = -0.130, P = 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant positive correlation between the perceived behavioral control and ''Fear of feeling pain during examination'' as a barrier (r = 0.130, P = 0.04). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the lack of training by health care providers (β = 0.16, P = 0.02) and being afraid of finding a lump in the breast (β = 0.13, P = 0.04) were positive predictors of TPB. Conversely, marriage age (β = -0.13, P = 0.049) and attitude toward BSE (β = -0.19, P = 0.005) were negative predictors of TPB construct. Additionally, ""fear of feeling pain during examination"" positively predicted perceived behavioral control (β = 0.13, P = 0.05). Notably, the results showed BSE practice was able to positively predict behavior (β = 0.94, P = 0.0001). Knowledge was positively associated with ""afraid of finding a lump in the breast"" (β = 0.13, P = 0.04). Low levels of knowledge about BC, BSE, symptoms, and risk factors point to the need for targeted planned behavior-based interventions."

The complexity of epigenetic changes that accompany aging has been distilled into a number of molecular timepieces-termed epigenetic clocks-that characterize the pace of biological aging to differing degrees. Here, we develop and validate a DNA methylation-based Physiological health Age (PhysAge) score, comprised of eight DNA methylation surrogates to represent multi-system physiology and developed from commonly measured clinical biomarkers: CRP, peak flow, pulse pressure, HDL-cholesterol, Hba1c, waist-to-height ratio (WHR), cystatin C, and dehydroepianrosterone sulphate (DHEAS). We use data from the population-representative US Health and Retirement Study (HRS), split into a training (n = 1589) and test sample (n = 1588) and corroborate findings in two independent cohorts: The Irish Longitudinal Study of Aging (TILDA; n = 488) and the Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA; n = 1830). PhysAge and the predominant second-generation epigenetic clocks, PhenoAge, GrimAge2, and DunedinPACE, were tested for their prediction of mortality and multiple age-related clinical measures (i.e., grip strength, gait speed, cognitive function, disability, frailty). PhysAge was comparable to extant clocks in predicting health measures and was indistinguishable from GrimAge2 in predicting mortality, despite not being trained on mortality. Moreover, the eight individual surrogates comprising PhysAge predicted health outcomes better than the measured values in many instances. The established clinical relevance of the biomarkers from which surrogates were derived opens up new opportunities for cross-study and cross-country comparisons of population health. Findings suggest that the DNA methylation PhysAge can be leveraged as a single biomarker to represent multiple physiological systems and offers utility in the context of clinical monitoring.

Aims: To investigate the changes in self-reported outcomes and body composition among colorectal cancer (CRC) patients over the course of chemotherapy and differences in body composition among different self-reported trajectory subgroups. Design: Prospective longitudinal study. Methods: This longitudinal study surveyed 201 CRC patients from a cancer hospital in Fuzhou, China. Collected via a patient-reported outcome questionnaire, a bioelectrical impedance analyzer, a grip strength meter, a 30-s standing and sitting test, body circumference measurements, and skinfold thickness measurements. We explored trends in the abovementioned variables in the early, middle, and late stages of chemotherapy in CRC patients and differences in body composition under different patient reporting trajectories. This study adhered to the relevant STROBE checklist-guided reporting. Results: The overall severity of the chemotherapy results reported by the patients increased from T1 to T2 (overall health outcome: -7.51%; function: -2.55%; and symptoms: 0.67%), followed by a slow recovery (overall health outcome: 1.31%; function: 1.83%; and symptoms: -2.79%). Different trajectory subgroups were observed, indicating the complexity of the patients' experiences during chemotherapy. During chemotherapy, obesity-related indicators (weight, BMI, body fat rate, etc.) significantly increased (p < 0.05). Although skeletal muscle mass did not change significantly over time (p > 0.05), the overall outcome and symptom trajectory subgroups reported by the patients during chemotherapy (p < 0.05) were significantly different. Conclusions: It is necessary for healthcare workers to conduct dynamic assessments of patients with moderate to severe self-reported results as early as possible, give attention to the deterioration of body composition during chemotherapy, and explore effective measures to improve patients' body compositions to further optimize the patient experience. Implications for Nursing Management: Nursing managers should promptly monitor patients' body composition and subjective experiences changes during treatment. Customized supportive care based on body composition measurements to optimize health outcomes, enhancing the personalization and precision of medical services.

The lung undergoes continuous remodeling throughout normal development and aging, including changes to alveolar and capillary structure and function. While histological methods allow for static analysis of these age-related changes, characterizing the changes that occur in response to mechanical stimuli remains difficult, particularly over a dynamic, physiologically relevant range in a functioning lung. Alveolar and capillary distension - the change in diameter of alveoli and capillaries, respectively, in response to pressure changes - is one such process, where dynamically controlling and monitoring the diameter of the same capillary or alveolus is essential to inferring its mechanical properties. We overcome these limitations by utilizing the recently developed crystal ribcage to image the alveoli and vasculature of a functional mouse lung across the lifespan in postnatal (6-7 days), young adult (12-18 weeks), and aged (20+ months) mice. Using a range of biologically relevant vascular (0-15 cmH2O) and transpulmonary (3-12 cm H2O) pressures, we directly quantify vascular and alveolar distention in the functional lung as we precisely adjust pulmonary pressures. Our results show differences in age-related alveolar and vascular distensibility: when we increase transpulmonary alveolar or vascular pressure, vessels in postnatal lungs expand less and undergo less radial and axial strain under each respective pressure type, suggesting stiffer capillaries than in older lungs. However, while vessels in young adult and aged lungs respond similarly to variations in vascular pressure, differences in elasticity start to emerge at the alveolar scale in response to transpulmonary alveolar pressure changes. Our results further indicate that differing effects of ventilation mode (i.e., positive vs. negative) present themselves at the capillary level, with vessels under positive pressure undergoing more compression than when under negative-pressure conditions. These findings contribute both to the understanding of the functional changes that occur within the lung across the lifespan, as well as to the debate of ventilation effects on lung microphysiology.

Cardio-cerebral coupling (CCC) refers to the dynamic interplay between cardiac function and cerebral blood flow, essential for maintaining hemodynamic stability. Disruptions in CCC are particularly relevant in critical care, where they can exacerbate primary and secondary brain injuries. Ultrasound-based techniques, including transcranial Doppler, transcranial color-coded Doppler, and echocardiography, provide non-invasive methods to assess this relationship at the bedside. This scoping review explores the pathophysiology of CCC, ultrasound methodologies for its evaluation, and its clinical relevance. Key mechanisms such as cerebral autoregulation and neurovascular coupling are discussed, along with ultrasound-derived parameters like pulsatility index, resistance index, and cerebral perfusion pressure. While ultrasound is a valuable tool, its limitations include operator dependency and equipment variability. Emerging evidence suggests that ultrasound-guided protocols, including ultrasound-guided cardio-cerebral resuscitation protocol and ultrasound-guided brain injury treatment protocol, may improve resuscitation strategies and neurocritical care monitoring. Despite its potential, further research is necessary to standardize assessment methods and integrate ultrasound-based CCC evaluation into routine clinical practice. Ongoing multicenter studies are expected to provide robust evidence supporting its clinical utility in managing brain-injured patients.

Semi-purified experimental diets were prepared by adding vitamin B12 at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/kg (Con, CB0.5, CB1.0, CB2.0, and CB4.0) and a negative control (NCon) diet was prepared with 0.3% tetracycline hydrochloride. Four replicate groups of shrimp (0.17 ± 0.01 g, 32 shrimp per tank) were fed one of the diets at 3-6% of body Weight for 8 weeks. CB2.0 diet significantly increased weight gain and feed efficiency of the shrimp compared to Con diet. The expressions of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-binding protein, regulatory-associated protein of mammalian target of rapamycin-like, crustin, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, and methionine synthase-like genes in hepatopancreas were significantly upregulated with increasing dietary vitamin B12 levels. Total hemocyte count, nitroblue tetrazolium, lysozyme, and antiprotease activities were significantly increased at higher vitamin B12 inclusion levels above 1.00 mg/kg. Phenoloxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase activities, and survival during the ammonia challenge were significantly higher in C2.0 group than in Con group. After the challenge test, C4.0 and C1.0 groups exhibited significantly higher nitroblue tetrazolium and phenoloxidase activities, respectively. Increasing dietary vitamin B12 levels linearly increased hemolymph, hepatopancreas, and fecal vitamin B12 levels. The polynomial regression analysis of final body weight indicated that the optimum dietary vitamin B12 requirement for juvenile Pacific white shrimp is 2.02 mg/kg.

Telemedicine has become an important mechanism for delivering health care in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. While some medical subspecialties were able to rapidly integrate telecare into their workflow, ophthalmology is one field in which telemedicine has not been as widely adopted. In this systematic review, we analyze published studies assessing patient and provider viewpoints on telemedicine for eye care. Our aim is to understand how adoption of teleophthalmology is being studied and whether definitive conclusions regarding patient and provider perspectives on telecare can be drawn from published literature. We performed a systematic PubMed search for studies utilizing surveys to assess patient and provider perspectives regarding remote eye care. Articles were excluded if they were irrelevant to teleophthalmology, did not assess patient or eye care provider perspectives regarding teleophthalmology, assessed specific platforms or aspects of eye care, were reviews without primary data, or if the survey used was not available. The questionnaires from the included articles were analyzed for validation status, subspecialty, question wording, and response format. The PubMed search returned 92 articles, 22 of which were included in the final dataset after exclusions. Only four studies utilized externally validated questionnaires, although several additional studies were based on validated items. Survey length, wording, and response formatting varied across the studies. These 22 studies contained responses from 3,796 patients and 2,388 eye care professionals, but the lack of standardization between the surveys makes high power conclusions impossible. The results of this review demonstrate a need to develop a standardized and validated survey instrument specifically for assessing teleophthalmology to identify barriers to widespread implementation.

Modulator therapies like ivacaftor have revolutionized clinical management of cystic fibrosis (CF), showing marked short-term benefits in trials but heterogeneous findings in long-term observational studies. Since newer modulators have become the standard of care for the majority living with CF in the U.S., characterizing long-term effectiveness with real-world data is increasingly difficult due to the lack of contemporary comparator groups for performing between-subjects analyses. To determine the extent to which ivacaftor preserves long-term lung function and compare the results of within- and between-subject analyses for evaluating its real-world effectiveness. This retrospective cohort study used data from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (2003-2016). We employed two approaches to evaluate ivacaftor effectiveness on percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1s (ppFEV1): i) within-subject comparisons of ppFEV1 before and after ivacaftor initiation and ii) comparisons between ivacaftor-treated and untreated individuals with similar disease pathology. We modeled data from 560 ivacaftor-treated individuals with the G551D variant. For between-subject comparisons, we used propensity scores to match the treated group with 2,800 untreated F508del homozygous individuals. Modulator initiation bias was assessed and accounted for in each model. Our results showed an initial average improvement in ppFEV1 in ivacaftor-treated children and adults (ranging from 4.54 to 6.53% predicted based on within-subject comparison of before vs. after ivacaftor initiation). There was a slower decline in adults, compared to children. These ivacaftor-treated cohorts experienced less decline relative to their F508del homozygous counterparts (between-group differences in treated vs. control ranged from 0.36 to 0.64% predicted). Both the within- and between-subject comparisons demonstrated similar levels of ivacaftor effectiveness. However, small differences between the two approaches were observed in younger individuals. Ivacaftor was associated with improved ppFEV1 across all age groups, with the magnitude of improvement roughly 50% of that observed in clinical trials. The results support the need to account for modulator initiation bias and the use of within-subject analysis in future CFTR modulator effectiveness studies, but caution is advised in younger individuals due to developmental changes that may affect pre- and post-treatment comparability.

Pediatric atopic dermatitis (AD) shows distinct clinical characteristics compared to adult AD, suggesting unique inflammatory profiles that may influence disease prognosis and treatment response. We aimed to identify unique immune signatures of pediatric AD and investigate the differences between pediatric and adult AD patients. Nine pediatric (6-16 years) and 12 adult (20-60 years) were enrolled. PBMCs were collected from AD patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Transcriptomic profiles were analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing, and the immune phenotypes of adult and pediatric AD were compared. Th2 gene expression was elevated in both adult and pediatric AD, while Th1, Th17, and Th22 gene expression was downregulated in pediatric AD but not in adults. Genes involved in JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which were upregulated in adult AD, were not significantly increased in pediatric AD. The CD6-activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) pathway was upregulated in pediatric AD compared to pediatric HCs, but not in adult AD. Pediatric AD reveals distinct immune signatures, including a lack of JAK/STAT pathway upregulation observed in adult AD and a unique activation of the CD6-ALCAM pathway. These findings highlight the importance of age-specific treatment strategies in AD patients.

The anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway describes the interaction between cholinergic vagal nerves and splenic immune cells, yet the exact mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway remain disputed. Here, we mapped the expression of key molecular components of the anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway in the adult mouse using RNAScope in situ hybridization (ISH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). In C57BL/6J wild-type male mice, we observed the expression of choline acetyltransferase (Chat) and alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Chrna7) in various autonomic neurons throughout the body, but not in the spleen, even after bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. In contrast, the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (Adrb2), another autonomic receptor with well-documented anti-inflammatory actions, was highly expressed in the spleen, with a significant decrease following LPS administration. Interestingly, Adrb2 was also expressed at lower levels in the spleen of a newly generated global knockout mouse for Chrna7. Lastly, we did not observe YFP-positive cells or axons in the spleen of the ChAT-Cre-ChR2-YFP mouse. Based on our findings, we propose a new model of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway that highlights the roles of extrasplenic cholinergic signaling.

40913314	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	A robust pleiotropy method with applications to lipid traits and to inflammatory bowel disease subtypes with sample overlap.	Pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a genetic region confers risk to multiple traits, is widely observed, even among seemingly unrelated traits. Knowledge of pleiotropy can improve understanding of biological mechanisms of diseases/traits, and can potentially guide identification of molecular targets or help predict side-effects in drug development. However, statistical approaches for identifying pleiotropy genome-wide are limited, particularly for two correlated traits or case-control traits with unknown sample overlap or for disease traits from family studies. We proposed PLACO+, an improved version of our pleiotropic analysis under composite null hypothesis method based on GWAS summary statistics from two traits. PLACO+ uses an inflated variance model to allow for fractions of variants to be associated with none or only one trait under the null. It is genome-wide scalable, where analytical p-value is computed as a weighted sum of extreme tail probabilities of bivariate normal product distribution. Simulations for both population-based and family-based designs demonstrate well-calibrated type I errors at stringent levels and substantially improved power of PLACO+ over conventional approaches. We illustrate PLACO+ on inflammatory bowel disease subtypes with shared controls and on correlated lipid traits with unknown sample overlap. In particular, PLACO+ revealed pleiotropic regions between triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein levels that conventional approaches missed and all of which were replicated in larger GWAS of these lipid traits. This further demonstrates the utility of PLACO+ in discovering genetic associations of traits with modest sample sizes by leveraging information from another correlated trait.

John is a 12-year-old African-American boy with a Specific Learning Disorder in Reading and Generalized Anxiety Disorder who you are seeing in follow-up at your clinic. Last fall, when John was having an escalation of his anxiety symptoms at school, he enacted the behavior intervention plan (BIP) that had been previously established by his educational team of informing his teacher that he needed to leave the classroom. He then paced the hallway outside of his classroom as a method of coping with the anxiety that he was experiencing. Approximately 3 months prior, John's teacher was unable to visualize him from her position in the classroom and subsequently called the School Resource Officer (SRO) to locate him. The SRO found John, who was in an emotionally dysregulated state. The SRO subsequently approached John who noted that he wanted to jump off a cliff. Rather than following the BIP which details the need to involve the school counselor and social worker when John is in an emotionally dysregulated state to perform a self-harm/threat assessment, the SRO bypassed this step and, instead, notified the emergency response team, who initiated a petition for psychiatric evaluation, thus temporarily limiting parental rights to make certain treatment decisions. This led to John being transported to the local Emergency Department (ED) in the backseat of a police vehicle.While in the ED, a urine toxicology assessment was performed which returned negative and John was subsequently evaluated by the child and adolescent psychiatrist on call who deemed that John was not an immediate threat to himself or others and discharged him home with his mother. Subsequent to this event, John exhibited refusal to return to school and would remain in his family's car for 30 to 60 minutes before entering the school in the morning. Once at school, he would go to an administrator's office where he felt safe, and his school work was brought to him. His long-standing therapist, who he had been seeing for management of anxiety, began providing Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy with John as a trauma-focused intervention to address the events he experienced at school.John continued to exhibit school avoidance and was placed on home-bound instruction by the school in the spring, which comprised 60 minutes of special education instruction in the home each week, without provision of general education instruction. John went from being an A/B student to earning Ds and Fs, and he was denied compensatory instructional services by the school in the summer.The family comes to your DBP clinic that summer asking for evaluation of his traumatic symptoms and to create a plan for the fall and returning to school.

Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is essential for detecting potential neurological injury during scoliosis surgery, but obtaining recordable baseline signals can be challenging in neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) patients. Absent baseline IONM signals, characterized by unattainable initial IONM responses despite technical and anesthetic optimization, present significant challenges to intraoperative neurological assessment and surgical risk stratification. This study aims to identify predictive factors for absent baseline IONM signals in pediatric NMS patients and establish a clinically applicable risk prediction model. This retrospective study initially identified 118 nonambulatory NMS patients under 18 years old who underwent spinopelvic fusion between 2013 and 2022. All patients received standardized total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) protocol to optimize signal acquisition. After excluding 3 patients with spinal cord injuries, 115 patients were analyzed. Multimodality IONM, including somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs) was attempted in all cases. Clinical data and radiographic measurements were analyzed to determine predictive factors for absent baseline IONM signal. ROC curve analysis and logistic regression were used to determine optimal thresholds and predictive factors for absent baseline IONM signals. Thirty-eight (33%) had absent baseline lower extremity IONM signals. Cerebral palsy (CP) was the most significant predictive factor [odds ratio (OR): 9.615, P<0.001], with 53.1% of CP patients having absent baseline IONM signals. Within the CP cohort, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level V (OR: 11.501, P=0.028) and body height <128.5 cm (OR: 4.097, P=0.044) were significant risk factors. Three patients developed new-onset urinary incontinence postoperatively, though the relationship to IONM status remains undetermined. Severe CP and shorter stature significantly increase the risk of absent baseline IONM signals in pediatric NMS patients. These findings inform preoperative risk assessment, enhance patient-specific surgical planning, and suggest the need for alternative monitoring approaches in high-risk cases. Such early identification of monitoring challenges can improve surgical preparation, consent processes, and ultimately patient care in this vulnerable population. Level III.

Clinical trials often face recruitment challenges. From the participant's perspective, barriers such as time commitment, travel to sites, and logistical burden, like arranging care duties or time off work, can deter enrolment. Decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) aim to address these by shifting activities closer to participants' homes and using online methods for recruitment and consent. This study explores recruitment strategies and remote eConsent implementation in a decentralized setting. The RADIAL trial, a three-arm, open-label, phase IV study in six European countries, enrolled participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus administering Insulin Glargine 300 U/ml. Recruitment strategies included online campaigns, search engine advertising, social media, and research database outreach. The remote consent process involved eConsent, telemedicine consultations, eIdentification, and eSignatures. Online recruitment campaigns generated a lot of impressions but led to very few pre-screener completions or enrolments. In contrast, outreach through research databases proved more effective, accounting for 7 of the 8 enrolled participants in the decentralized arm. Major pre-screening drop-off occurred at the initial consent step, with 69% exiting before data collection. Eleven participants successfully completed eConsent; 4 others required remote paper-based consent due to eIdentification issues. Implementing the multimedia-enhanced eConsent system was resource-intensive, complicated by country-specific layouts and differing regulatory requirements. Tailored recruitment strategies and simplified remote consent processes are needed to enhance the accessibility and efficiency of DCTs. Further research should optimize targeting and keyword use in online recruitment.

Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) offers a crucial method for administering intravenous/intramuscular antimicrobials outside of hospital settings, allowing patients to complete treatment safely while avoiding many hospital-acquired complications. This is a major boost or low-hanging fruit intervention in antimicrobial stewardship practices with multiple targets like decreasing hospital stays, its related complications, the economy, the burden on hospitals, etc. However, resource-constrained countries like India practices rarely OPAT in an evidence-based way. To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility along with barriers and facilitators of OPAT practices in resource-poor settings, with a focus on its role in antimicrobial stewardship. This pilot longitudinal observational study included patients who met OPAT checklist criteria and were committed to post-discharge follow-up. Pre-discharge education and counselling were provided, and demographic data were recorded. Various outcome measures, including barriers and facilitators, were identified through an extensive literature review, fishbone diagram preparation, data collection and analysis, and patient feedback. All healthcare workers who were taking care of the patients discharged with OPAT were contacted with open-ended questions to get data on feasibility. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh. We used descriptive analysis and the χ 2 test to analyze data. P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Out of 20 patients, the mean age was 37 years. The cohort comprised 13 males. OPAT was administered at home in 15 cases and at nursing homes in 5 cases, with nine patients receiving treatment from family members and 11 patients receiving care from a local nurse. The infections requiring OPAT included: Kidney-urinary tract (6 cases), gastrointestinal tract (4 cases), respiratory tract (4 cases), meningitis (3 cases), endocarditis (2 cases), and multiple visceral abscesses (1 case). Nineteen out of 20 patients achieved afebrile status. Half of the patients did not receive education, counselling, or demonstrations prior to discharge, but all patients rated the service as good/excellent. According to doctors' feedback, OPAT is highly beneficial and effective for patients when systematically implemented with daily telephonic monitoring, but faces challenges due to the lack of standardized protocols, dedicated teams, and adequate resources. The implementation of OPAT resulted in a reduction of hospitalization duration by an average of two weeks. This pilot study proves that OPAT is safe, feasible, and efficacious by reducing two weeks of hospitalization in resource-poor settings. OPAT contributes directly to antimicrobial stewardship by reducing hospital stays and hospital-acquired complications, which is vital in combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and aligns with the global action plan for AMR in infection prevention and optimal antimicrobial utilization.

Current commercial cerebral oximeters only monitor the frontal lobes, however, some cerebrovascular territories may experience ischemia while others remain well perfused. This pilot study used a novel, high-density, dual-wavelength, time-resolved functional cerebral oximeter (Kernel Flow) with 2000 channels to assess the regional differences of cerebral oxygenation (StO2) in response to hypotension across different vascular territories during shoulder surgery in the beach chair position. Twenty-seven adult patients were monitored, recording blood pressure, heart rate, regional cerebral oxygen saturation, and other vital parameters. For each hypotensive event, regional cerebral oxygen saturations were compared against each other using a mixed-effect model. Data processing involved moment analysis and MATLAB-based detrending to correct for temperature-induced signal drifts. Twenty-one hypotensive events were excluded due to poor data quality. Results from 16 hypotensive events in 4 patients indicated no significant temporal or amplitude differences in StO2 across 8 cerebrovascular territories. The mean±SD decrease in systolic blood pressure was 30.2±18.3 mm Hg, resulting in a mean cerebral desaturation across all territories of 3.3%±1.8%. There were no statistically significant temporal or magnitude differences between different vascular territories, though large variabilities were observed. Despite limitations, such as small sample size and the exclusion of large number of events, this pilot study demonstrates that StO2 changes in response to hypotension in multiple brain regions can be measured and compared during surgery, providing insights and facilitating investigation of the selective vulnerability of brain regions. Future exploration will enhance our understanding of cerebral ischemia pathophysiology and perioperative stroke.

Emergency medicine simulation is an effective training modality in both high and low resource settings. We describe the authors' experiences conducting a four-week interdisciplinary, in situ, simulation training series at an emergency centre in Burundi. Training emphasized effective closed loop communication, early airway, breathing, and circulation assessment, as well as time to vital signs, IV placement, and oxygen administration when appropriate. Six doctor-nursing teams participated in four training sessions as well as pre- and post-test simulation cases which were graded by an independent evaluator. The training resulted in a statistically significant improvement in closed loop communication as well as notable narrowing in standard deviation of times to critical actions after the training intervention. Although the small sample size and large variation of data limited their statistical significance, these results may indicate a short-term benefit towards early assessment, management and team communication when simulating management of critical patients. Additionally, we found that interdisciplinary, in situ simulation was a safe and likely beneficial option for training and team building in a resource-limited emergency centre. While this pilot study establishes feasibility of low-cost, interdisciplinary emergency simulation training in resource-limited settings, further research is needed to establish educational effectiveness on quality-of-care measures and its generalizability to other contexts prior to implementing similar trainings.

(1) Background: Domestic violence (DV), including intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy and the puerperium, represents a major public health issue, significantly affecting maternal and child health. (2) Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines, aimed to identify screening tools used to detect DV and IPV among pregnant and postpartum women and to estimate DV prevalence. The protocol was published in PROSPERO in advance (CRD42023473392). (3) Results: A comprehensive literature search across PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted on 1 January 2024, resulting in 34,720 records; 98 studies met the inclusion criteria. The included studies were conducted in over 40 countries, and most were cross-sectional. Commonly used screening tools included the WHO Women's Health and Life Experiences Questionnaire, the Abuse Assessment Screen, and the WHO Violence Against Women Instrument. Meta-analyses showed that 10% of women experienced physical violence, 26% psychological violence, 9% sexual violence, 16% verbal violence, and 13% economic violence. The overall prevalence of IPV during pregnancy and the puerperium was 26%. Despite the widespread use of validated instruments, substantial heterogeneity was observed, underscoring the need for standardization. (4) Conclusion: These findings underline the urgent need to integrate routine IPV screening into maternal care pathways using validated, culturally adapted tools, ensuring women's safety and confidentiality.

The adult human neural stem cell (ahNSC)-conditioned medium (CM) contains various secreted factors that promote tissue repair and neuroprotection. This study aimed to identify the key secreted proteins in ahNSC-CM and investigate the role of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) in wound healing, angiogenesis, and neuroprotection against oxygenglucose deprivation. Cytokine array and liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry analysis of ahNSC-CM revealed that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and TIMP-1 were highly abundant. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed the enrichment of both in ahNSC-CM. Recombinant human TIMP-1 promoted wound closure and angiogenesis, whereas neutralizing TIMP-1 in ahNSC-CM attenuated these effects, with wound healing involving the extracellular signalregulated kinases 1 and 2 and protein kinase B pathways. Furthermore, ahNSC-CM protected neurons from oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis, and this neuroprotective effect was partially reversed by TIMP-1 neutralization, potentially through the modulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 and B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein expression. Consistent with findings in ahNSCs, where monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 is highly expressed and contributes to pro-angiogenic effects, our study highlights the importance of secreted factors such as TIMP-1 in the therapeutic potential of ahNSC-CM. These findings suggest that TIMP-1 is a significant component of ahNSC-CM and contributes to its regenerative and neuroprotective properties.

The Age-Friendly Health Systems initiative (AFHS) was developed to spread principles of high-quality care for older adults using the 4Ms Framework: What Matters, Medications, Mentation and Mobility. In 2020, the Veterans Health Affairs (VA) set a goal to become an AFHS, given nearly half of Veterans are over aged 65. This quality improvement study followed the Model for Improvement which guided a series of Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles to implement and spread the AFHS model within the VA, as measured by clinical sites receiving AFHS recognition from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI). A national AFHS Steering Committee was formed, followed by a 4Ms note template and dashboard. VA ran 3 AFHS Action Communities which included synchronous training sessions and coaching calls in 4Ms care. IHI recognition was tracked over 5 years for VA sites. The Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2.0 guidelines (SQuIRE) were used. From 2020 to 2025, 455 VA care settings earned Level 1 recognition from IHI at 138/139 (99%) of VA parent facilities. 268/455 (59%) sites have gone on to achieve Level 2 recognition. 66% of Level 1 sites are ambulatory, 7% are acute care, and 24% are nursing homes. Since 2022 when the VA AFHS note template was implemented, 163 000 unique Veterans have been recorded as having been reached with 4Ms care, of whom 71% reside in urban areas, 23% are aged 85 and older, and 59% are aged 65 to 84. The VA implemented the AFHS initiative at nearly all VA parent facilities over 5 years, spreading the 4Ms model of Age-Friendly care across geographic and care settings. Further study is needed on the clinical impact of and optimal implementation strategies for AFHS. The VA experience offers a promising model for health systems seeking to implement AFHS.

This study evaluated and compared invalidation domains (discounting and lack of understanding) in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and non-FM chronic musculoskeletal pain. The relationship between invalidation and depression was also investigated to clarify the role of FM. A total of 207 patients (145 FM and 62 non-FM) completed questionnaires including the Illness Invalidation Inventory (3*I), Widespread Pain Index (WPI), Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), and Beck Depression Inventory-second edition (BDI-II). Adjusted linear regression analyses were performed to assess the association between the 3*I and BDI-II, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between FM (as the dependent variable) and other variables. WPI, FIQR, BDI-II, and 3*I scores were significantly higher in FM patients than in non-FM patients. The BDI-II total score was found to be a significant predictor of discounting and lack of understanding stemming from spouse and family sources in both groups, with slightly stronger effects in the non-FM group than in FM patients. In multivariate regression analysis, discounting from family sources (odds ratio [OR] = 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-3.20, P = 0.040) and the BDI-II total score (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.06-1.20, P = 0.001) remained a determinant of having FM. The higher frequency of invalidation in FM patients is not fully explained by depression because of weaker statistical relationships between invalidation and depression in FM rather than other pain disorders.

Echocardiography is the primary imaging tool for evaluating cardiac structure and function in patients with primary hypertension. A significant limitation of the current literature is that most studies focus on older adults, leaving a significant gap in understanding the cardiac effects of primary hypertension in young adults. This scoping review protocol aims to assess conventional echocardiographic parameters, left ventricular geometric patterns, and advanced echocardiographic findings for the early detection of cardiac changes in young adults aged 18-39 with primary hypertension. A systematic literature search will be conducted across the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Central databases. This involves systematically reviewing existing literature to outline the reported echocardiographic findings, the parameters analysed, and the abnormalities identified within this population. It will establish the foundation for future reviews and primary research, supporting the evaluation of the diagnostic and prognostic significance of these findings for early detection and risk assessment, ranging from standard conventional measures to more advanced methods.

Recalcitrant plantar fasciitis (PF) refers to persistent heel pain lasting ≥ 6 months despite appropriate conservative management, including physical therapy, orthotics, and pharmacological interventions. This study aimed to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injection (CI), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and their combination in patients with recalcitrant PF. In this retrospective study, a total of 156 patients with ultrasonographically confirmed plantar fasciitis, experiencing heel pain for at least 6 months and unresponsive to ≥ 3 months of standard conservative therapy, were included; 52 received RFA, 50 received CI, and 54 underwent combined therapy. Pain intensity (visual analog scale [VAS]), functional status (Foot Function Index [FFI], Roles and Maudsley score [RMS]), plantar fascia thickness (PFT), and relapse rates at 12 months were assessed. Within-group and between-group differences were assessed using appropriate nonparametric tests, and relapse rates were compared accordingly. All treatment modalities improved VAS, FFI, RMS, and PFT at 6 months (p < 0.001). VAS declined from 6.73 to 6.81 at baseline to 1.62 in the RFA group and 1.83 in the combined group, whereas remaining at 6.56 in the CI group. FFI dropped from ∼52 to 21.50 and 17.57 in the RFA and combined groups but remained at 46.62 in the CI. PFT decreased from ∼6.2 mm to 3.29, 2.71, and 2.95 mm, respectively. Relapse occurred in 12 (23.1%), 19 (38.0%), and 8 (14.8%) patients in the RFA, CI, and combined groups. Between-group differences were significant at 6 months (p < 0.001). No major adverse events were observed. Both CI and RFA are effective in recalcitrant PF, but their combination provides superior and more durable improvements in pain, function, and fascia morphology, with the lowest relapse rates. Ultrasound-guided combined therapy suggests a safe, practical, and effective treatment option for patients unresponsive to conservative measures.

In the fields of both vestibular and auditory research, reliable vestibular function tests are essential. However, unlike the auditory function tests, which use standard Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) equipment, there is no equivalent widely adopted apparatus for vestibular tests. Vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs) are the compensatory ocular reflexes that ensure stable vision during head motion. VORs are widely used in clinics to diagnose vestibular deficits. In the research, VORs have been used by various groups to evaluate the mouse vestibular function. However, the effectiveness of VOR tests has not been systematically evaluated with appropriate mouse models, and the lack of commercial equipment hampers its accessibility, confining vestibular testing to a select few labs. In this study, we developed an integrated and surgery-free instrument system with both angular VOR (aVOR) and off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) modes for evaluating mouse vestibular function. In addition, the eye rotation calibrations used in this study standardize the data between instruments. To demonstrate its validity and efficacy of the testing equipment, we evaluated four mouse models, including both genders, with peripheral vestibular deficits: 1) mice injected with the vestibulotoxic drug 3,3'-iminodiproprionitrile (IDPN, 2 mg/g and 4 mg/g, 3 male/3 female per group); 2) Critical MET-related mutant mice (Cdh23v2J/v2J, 4 male/4 female and TMC1-/-, 6 male/5 female); 3) Vestibular-specific mutant mice (Zpld1-/-, 6 male/6 female, for semicircular canal dysfunction and Otop1tlt/tlt, 3 male/2 female, for otoconia deficient); 4) Unilateral vestibular lesion (UVL) mouse model (3 male/3 female per group) where gentamicin was injected into horizontal semicircular canal. The results showed: 1) Quantification of vestibular deficits can be achieved as a daily routine; 2) Both the horizontal semicircular canal and otolith organs can be assessed, respectively; and 3) The lesion side of UVL can be identified. These test results reveal the potential of our system as standard equipment for evaluating common vestibular deficits in mice.

Despite the availability of these therapies, maintaining long-term adherence remains a significant challenge. This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate 12-month and 5-year persistence with antidementia drug therapy in Germany and to examine the association between demographic and clinical variables and the risk of therapy discontinuation. Patients aged 60 years or older from the IQVIA Longitudinal Prescription Database who received an initial prescription for antidementia therapy between 2016 and 2023 (index date) were included. Time to discontinuation was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess associations between predefined variables and the risk of discontinuation. The study included 567,815 patients (mean age: 80.2 years, 59.1% female). Five years after the index date, 19.8% of dementia patients were still receiving therapy, with a 12-month persistence rate of 53.1%. Cox regression models conducted for the total population revealed that younger age (<70 versus ≥90 years; HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.19-1.23; 71-80 years versus ≥90 years; HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.11-1.14) was significantly associated with an increased risk of therapy discontinuation. Initiating therapy with memantine was associated with a slightly lower risk of discontinuation compared to donepezil (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.86-0.87). In this study, half of the patients discontinued antidementia therapy within one year and 80% within five years. Younger age was linked to a higher risk of therapy discontinuation, while memantine therapy was associated with improved persistence, potentially reflecting better adherence among patients with more advanced dementia.
40909225	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article;Systematic Review;Network Meta-Analysis	Network meta-analysis on the efficacy of different interventions for treating thin endometrium.	The incidence of thin endometrium in assisted reproductive technology (ART) is between 1% and 2.5%, yet its treatment options are varied and often show limited efficacy. There is an urgent need to delineate the relative effectiveness of various interventions to guide clinical practice. This study aims to systematically compare the efficacy of different interventions for treating thin endometrium via a network meta-analysis, focusing on improvements in endometrial thickness and clinical pregnancy rates. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CBM, and CNKI databases, covering literature until December 31, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating treatments for thin endometrium were included and assessed for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Stata 17.0 software was used for the network meta-analysis, employing Bayesian methods to construct network diagrams and calculate the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Eighteen RCTs involving six interventions (oral aspirin, Ding Kun Dan, intrauterine infusion of platelet-rich plasma [PRP], intrauterine infusion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], intramuscular injection of recombinant human growth hormone [rhGH], and neuromuscular electrical stimulation [NMES]) were included. The network meta-analysis revealed: 1) Endometrial thickness: All intervention groups showed varying degrees of effectiveness in increasing thickness compared to the control group. The top three ranked in effectiveness were G-CSF (SUCRA = 78.48%), aspirin (SUCRA = 70.89%), and PRP (SUCRA = 68.14%). 2) Clinical pregnancy rate: PRP ranked highest in improving pregnancy rates (SUCRA = 80.12%), followed by aspirin (SUCRA = 70.29%) and Ding Kun Dan (SUCRA = 62.79%). Overall, PRP showed significant advantages in both increasing endometrial thickness and improving clinical pregnancy rates, making it the most promising intervention. PRP demonstrates the best clinical application potential in treating thin endometrium, particularly in improving clinical pregnancy rates. Future high-quality RCTs are necessary to further validate and optimize intervention strategies.

Locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LA-NPC) has a heterogeneous prognosis, with approximately one-fourth of patients experiencing poor outcomes. Studies have explored the application of induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy, but its efficacy was controversial. The protocol was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42024619387). The primary outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR), and the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Meta-analysis was performed using Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager 5.4.1 and Meta-Analyst Beta 3.13 statistical software. The meta-analysis involving 1680 patients with LA-NPC from 7 studies showed that the induction chemoimmunotherapy group had significantly better ORR (odds ratio[OR] = 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.44-2.86, P < 0.01), and CRR (OR = 2.61, 95% CI:1.55-4.38, P < 0.01) than the induction chemotherapy group. The pooled ORR and CRR of induction chemoimmunotherapy were 92.7% (95% CI: 90.7-94.7%) and 24.3% (95% CI: 15.2-33.6%), respectively. There was no significant difference of TRAEs between induction chemotherapy group and induction chemoimmunotherapy group (OR = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.92-1.39, P = 0.23). Induction chemoimmunotherapy could be a promising induction treatment option for LA-NPC patients, improving ORR and CRR with an acceptable safety profile. However, due to limitations in this meta-analysis, further large-scale, well-designed clinical trials are required to validate these results and optimise treatment strategies.

No stroke-specific cognitive screen currently exists for community-dwelling chronic stroke survivors, with primary care and community settings relying on dementia tools which often do not consider specific post-stroke impairments. The Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) was developed for use in acute stroke, but its administration time is prohibitive for brief screening. Here, we aimed to develop, standardise and psychometrically validate the Mini-Oxford Cognitive Screen (Mini-OCS), a brief (<8 min) cognitive screen aimed for use in chronic stroke. Existing full OCS data for 464 English participants who were ⩾6 months post-stroke were analysed for the possibility of a short-form. Theoretical choices were made to adapt the short-form to be suitable for use in chronic stroke. The Mini-OCS was then completed by 164 neurologically healthy controls (Mage = 68.66; SD = 12.18, Myears of education 15.40; SD = 3.64, 61% female), and 89 chronic stroke survivors (Mage = 69.86; SD = 14.83, Myears education = 14.29; SD = 4.01, 44.94% female, Mdays since stroke = 597.02; SD = 881.12, 78.57% ischaemic, Median NIHSS = 6.5 (IQR = 4-11)). In addition, the original OCS, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and an extended neuropsychological battery were administered. Psychometric properties of the Mini-OCS were evaluated via construct validity and retest reliability. Normative data for the Mini-OCS is provided and known-group discrimination demonstrates increased sensitivity in the memory and executive function domains compared to the OCS. The Mini-OCS further met all appropriate benchmarks for evidence of retest reliability and construct validity. The Mini-OCS is a short-form standardised cognitive screening tool with initial evidence of good psychometric properties for use in a chronic stroke population.

This study examined the interplay between anxiety, depression, rumination, and problematic internet use (PIU) among 24,470 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 14.37 years; 51.60 percent male), with particular attention to socioeconomic status (SES) variations. Using data from June to August 2024 across three Chinese regions, researchers employed standardized measures including the Children's Depression Inventory, Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, Ruminative Response Scale, and Internet Addiction Test. Regularized partial correlation network analysis revealed symptom rumination and social anxiety as both core and bridging symptoms within the network structure. The overall network strength differed significantly between SES groups (high SES = 8.476 vs low SES = 8.683). Low-SES adolescents exhibited higher centrality in low self-esteem, while high-SES adolescents demonstrated higher centrality in time management and performance difficulties. Symptom rumination and social anxiety exhibited the highest strength and bridge centrality in the overall network, highlighting their key roles in linking psychological issues with PIU. SES-related network differences highlight how socioeconomic context may be associated with different psychological pathways to PIU. These findings inform a more nuanced and context-sensitive understanding of PIU etiology. However, given the limitations of the SES measure used in this study, including reliance on a single subjective item and dichotomized grouping, these observations should be interpreted with caution.

Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)/corticotropin-releasing hormone production by tumours causes 5-10% of Cushing's syndrome cases. We present a 21-patient case series with ectopic Cushing's syndrome (ECS) from a tertiary care institute in India. Data were collected retrospectively for patients from 1984 to 2004 and prospectively thereafter till 2019. This included clinical signs, diagnostic tests, comorbidities, imaging, management, outcomes, and follow-up data. In this study of 21 patients (14 males, mean age 32.4 ± 14 years) diagnosed with ECS, the mean lag period between the symptom onset and diagnosis was 15.9 ± 11.9 months. Predominant symptoms were proximal muscle weakness (85.7%), menstrual irregularity (85.7% of females), hyperpigmentation (76.2%), weight gain (61.9%), and infections (23.8%). Key signs included cuticular atrophy (100%), easy bruising (95.2%), and striae (71.4%). Despite 33.3% losing weight, 61.3% gained. 71.4% of the patients experienced diabetes, and 90.5% had hypertension as their metabolic complications. All patients exhibited disrupted cortisol circadian rhythms. The mean cortisol level at 0800 h was 1220 ± 556.2 nmol/L, while at 2300 h, it was 1108.3 ± 491.7 nmol/L. The median 0800-hour ACTH was 139 pg/ml. 22.2% displayed a paradoxical increase in morning cortisol post-high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Thymic carcinoid is as prevalent as bronchial carcinoid in ECS causation. ECS is rare, but it is crucial to distinguish it from Cushing's disease, as tumour removal is the preferred treatment. In Cushing's syndrome evaluations, ECS should always be considered since no single test is definitive for its diagnosis.

The ligamentum teres (LT) plays an important role in the general stability of the hip joint. A high prevalence of concomitant LT pathology has been noted in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. This increased prevalence has led to the development of multiple treatment options, including reconstruction techniques using different types of grafts. The current literature on outcomes of LT reconstruction is limited. To evaluate the outcomes of LT reconstruction with tibialis anterior allograft treatment for LT tears with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Data were retrospectively analyzed for all patients who underwent arthroscopic LT reconstruction with a tibialis anterior allograft between 2014 and 2021. Preoperatively and a minimum of 2 years postoperatively, included patients had completed questionnaires for the following patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures: modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Non-Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), Hip Outcome Score-Sports Specific Subscale (HOS-SSS), 12-item International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12) score, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain score, and patient satisfaction score; or they had a documented endpoint within the study's time frame. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was calculated for the mentioned PROs and included in the analysis. Survivorship was also evaluated and included in the analysis. A total of 22 patients were included in the study. Significant improvement was shown in mHHS, NAHS, HOS-SSS, iHOT-12 score, and VAS pain score. A high patient satisfaction score was also observed at the latest follow-up. Furthermore, a high percentage of patients reached the calculated MCID for the mHHS, NAHS, HOS-SSS, and VAS score. Patients demonstrated 95.5% survivorship. Arthroscopic LT reconstruction with a tibialis anterior allograft, concomitant with labral repairs and osteoplasties for femoroacetabular impingement, has shown favorable outcomes, high patient satisfaction rates, and a high percentage of patients reaching clinically important thresholds, with a low rate of complications and total hip arthroplasty conversion at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Furthermore, the choice of a graft rests in the hands of the surgeon based on training, familiarity, circumstances, and resources, as the optimal graft option has yet to be elucidated.

This study aimed to explore the influence mechanism of job insecurity on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Specifically, it sought to examine the chained mediating role of emotional exhaustion and organizational identification in this relationship. A longitudinal time-lagged survey was conducted on 330 employees at two time points. The data were collected using established scales for job insecurity, emotional exhaustion, organizational identification, and OCB. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypothesized chained mediation model. The results confirmed that emotional exhaustion and organizational identification are crucial mediators. Three significant indirect pathways were identified: (1) a simple mediation path through emotional exhaustion; (2) a simple mediation path through organizational identification; and (3) a chained mediation path where job insecurity increased emotional exhaustion, which in turn decreased organizational identification, ultimately leading to lower OCB. Notably, emotional exhaustion emerged as the most dominant mediating mechanism. This study reveals a complex mechanism through which job insecurity impacts OCB, highlighting a sequential process from emotional strain to cognitive detachment. These findings offer important theoretical insights for job stress models and provide practical guidance for organizations to mitigate the negative effects of job insecurity by addressing both employee well-being and their sense of belonging.

The influence of nerve blocks on treatment bias, a form of implicit bias where patient characteristics lead to inequal treatment, remains unexplored. This was a pilot study that utilized a survey to collect data from nurses at a single academic medical center. The following information was collected from the respondents: age (years); gender (male, female, other); nursing experience (years); specialization (surgery, medicine, emergency, perioperative, other); prior formal training on pain management in patients with or without nerve blocks; and how frequently they encounter patients with nerve blocks. Hypothetical clinical scenarios were presented to investigate pain medication dosing strategies that were rated with a 3-point Likert scale (more, equal, or less medication). Impacts of various patient conditions (alcohol abuse, anxiety, depression, marijuana use, nerve block, opioid abuse, and substance abuse) on pain medication and opioid dosing strategies were further investigated with a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree). Overall, the survey had a 32.59% response rate. Treatment bias towards patients with nerve blocks was evident in 21.43% (9/42) and 11/30 (36.67%) of respondents for pain medications and opioids, respectively. This pilot study suggests that patients with nerve blocks may be treated differently than those without blocks, regardless of their reported pain. However, given the study's exploratory design, these findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating.

The interprofessional educational curriculum for patient and personnel safety is of critical importance, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to prepare junior multiprofessional teams for emergency settings. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative interprofessional educational curriculum that integrated medical movies, massive open online courses (MOOCs), and 3D computer-based or virtual reality (VR) simulation-based interprofessional education (SimBIE) with team co-debriefing to enhance interprofessional collaboration and team performance using Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS). This study addressed 3 key questions. First, it aimed to examine the impact of 3D computer-based and VR SimBIE with co-debriefing following medical movies and MOOCs on improving TeamSTEPPS competencies compared to 3D computer-based SimBIE without preparation or debriefing. Second, it explored learners' perceptions of TeamSTEPPS effectiveness using the New World Kirkpatrick model. Third, it assessed differences in Simulator Sickness Questionnaire scores between the 3D and VR SimBIE formats. This mixed methods, prospective, double-blinded (raters and statistician) quasi-experimental study was conducted at a university hospital from August 2022 to September 2023 and involved 87 clinical undergraduate students from various disciplines, including medicine, nursing, pharmacy, radiology, and medical technology. Students were divided into 3 arms: arm A (control) received 3D computer-based SimBIE without debriefing; arm B received a medical movie, MOOCs, 3D computer-based SimBIE, and co-debriefing; and arm C received the same as arm B but with VR-based SimBIE. The validated Modified TeamSTEPPS Team Performance Observation Tool was used to measure team performance. A 60- to 90-minute focus group discussion with semistructured interview questions, based on the New World Kirkpatrick model and aligned with the TeamSTEPPS framework, was conducted with subsequent thematic analysis. In total, 87 participants were enrolled in this study. TeamSTEPPS' performance was significantly higher (P<.001) in arms B and C, which received comprehensive training with medical videos, MOOCs, and 3D computer-based or VR-based SimBIE with co-debriefing, compared to the control group. Additionally, the analysis of focus group discussions based on Kirkpatrick's model levels 1 to 3 indicated positive effects on satisfaction, engagement, knowledge, skills, attitude, and confidence, enriched by game practice and debriefing sessions. Simulator Sickness Questionnaire scores increased significantly in arm C (VR; Δ=21.0; P=.001) but not in arm B (computer; Δ=5.3; P=.44). Integrating TeamSTEPPS with medical movies, MOOCs, 3D computer-based or VR-based SimBIE training, and co-debriefing effectively improved interprofessional collaboration and team performance in emergency medicine. We recommend adopting these novel instructional designs as standard preparation of undergraduate health care professionals for better clinical practice to improve patient and personnel safety and patient outcomes.

From a public health perspective it is remarkable that there are yet no longitudinal studies in the general population investigating the influence of the basal immune state, measured before the pandemic, on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. To investigate the specific and combined effects of personal levels of cytokines and immunoglobulins-measured in individuals' blood 4 years before the pandemic-on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in a general population. We conducted a prospective cohort study in 240 individuals from the general population of Barcelona. Thirty cytokines and 31 immunoglobulins were quantified in prepandemic serum samples (collected in 2016-17) by high-throughput multiplex quantitative suspension array technology. Higher concentrations in 2016-17 of IL-8 and TNF-α significantly decreased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in 2020-21, whereas higher concentrations of MIP-1α were a risk factor for seropositivity. Most cytokines in mixtures with IL-8, MIP-1α, TNF-α or G-CSF were associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (all OR ≥2.0 or OR≤0.4 and p < 0.05). The five individual isotype-antigen pairs more clearly associated with seropositivity were: protectively, IgG to CMV pp150, IgG to CMV pp65, and IgG to N OC43; and, increasing risk of seropositivity, IgM to CMV pp65 and IgM to EBV EA-D. The four cytokines most consistently associated with the risk of COVID-19 were also G-CSF, IL-8, TNF-α, and MIP-1α. The four isotype-antigen pairs more strongly associated with risk of COVID-19 (all protective) were IgA to CMV pp65 and N 229E, and IgG to EBV EAD and VCAp18. The unique longitudinal design of this study, with measurements before and during the pandemic in a general population, provides novel knowledge on the protective and detrimental effects of specific individual cytokines and immunoglobulins, and their mixtures, on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and COVID-19. If confirmed, findings would be significantly relevant for medicine and public health.

Peripheral sensory neurons, once regarded merely as a passive route for nociceptive signals, are now acknowledged as active participants in solid tumor progression. This review explores how sensory neurons influence and are influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME) through both chemical and electrical signaling, underscoring their pivotal role in the emerging field of cancer neuroscience. We summarize recent findings indicating that cancer-neuron interactions vary among different organs and experimental models, highlighting the ways in which various tumors recruit and reprogram sensory neurons to establish mutual communication loops that foster malignancy. Clinically, the degree of sensory innervation and the level of neuropeptide signaling show promise as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, while targeting these pathways may enhance the efficacy of standard cancer treatments. This review also highlights current knowledge gaps and proposes future research directions aimed at disrupting sensory neuron-tumor interactions, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes across multiple cancer types.

Australians with life-limiting conditions can, with appropriate support, have a home death, if that is their choice. General practitioners (GPs) are essential for coordinating care and managing symptoms. Necessary medicines must be quickly available to provide responsive symptom management in the terminal phase. GPs can facilitate prompt availability of medicines by working collaboratively with pharmacists who have a shared understanding of the required medicines. This article explains the development of, and provides information about, the National Core Community Palliative Care Medicines List. A group of healthcare professionals with community palliative care expertise (Expert Group) compared the medicines to manage terminal phase symptoms against a set of criteria, choosing four core medicines based on their ability to manage symptoms, cost and ease of use. Creating a standardised National Core Community Palliative Care Medicines List supports clinical communication by providing an accepted baseline for symptom management; however, it should not replace communication between prescribers and pharmacists; rather, it should support collaborative practices.

The timing of elective surgery for asymptomatic congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) at birth remains controversial. We aimed to describe characteristics and outcomes of patients who underwent surgery for CPAM. We retrospectively identified patients aged < 18 years who were hospitalized for CPAM during the neonatal period and underwent surgery between July 2010 and March 2022 using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in Japan. We grouped eligible patients into those aged < 28 days (neonatal group) and ≥ 28 days (infant group) at surgery. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, morbidity, duration of anesthesia, and hospital stay. We identified 105 neonates and 287 infants (including 89, 107, and 91 aged 28 days to 5 months, 6-12 months, and > 12 months, respectively). In-hospital mortality and morbidity were similar among the groups. In the infant group, duration of anesthesia was longer in those with preoperative admission due to bacterial pneumonia or who underwent thoracoscopic surgery. Infants with congenital malformation or emergency admission had longer hospital stays. In-hospital mortality and morbidity were comparable among the different timings of surgery for CPAM. Preoperative bacterial pneumonia and thoracoscopic surgery could be risk factors for long duration of anesthesia but not for long hospital stay.

To study the biopsychosocial model of chronic low back pain in the workplace and the role of sex in it. Cross-sectional nationwide survey in a service company. 256 workers (women 64.1%) reporting chronic low back pain. Variables on biometry, job description, physical activity, pain severity/interference, neuropathic features, and questionnaire-based cognitive and affective parameters were collected. Within each sex group, the interrelationships between variables by Multiple Correspondence Analysis were analysed, followed by cluster analysis. In the overall sample, neuropathic features were reported by 28.9% of the patients; the cluster including the high pain disorder modalities (i.e., severity and interference) also included high pain catastrophizing and fear/avoidance towards work, as well as neuropathic features. However, in men, the modalities neighbouring high pain disorder were high anxiety and depression, and low mental quality of life, while in women, they were kinesiophobia, high fear/avoidance towards physical activity and stress at work, and low physical quality of life. As there is now a major demand for defining chronic low back pain patients based on their biopsychosocial profile to improve care and prognosis, this study's results indicate the relevance of conducting such phenotyping at an early stage in a working environment, and that it is preferable to construct predictive models for each sex group.

Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that delivering approach bias modification (ApBM) during residential alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment helps prevent post-treatment relapse. However, few studies have examined ApBM's efficacy for AUD in outpatients. We trialled a personalised ApBM smartphone app in individuals receiving outpatient AUD treatment. This double-blind RCT randomised participants to receive ApBM or sham training, adjunctive to treatment as usual. Participants were recruited from alcohol and other drug treatment services in Melbourne, Australia. 79 participants (mean age 46.6 years; 45 male, 34 female) installed the app between May 2022 and January 2024. In the ApBM condition, the app delivered personalised, gamified ApBM. Notifications prompted participants (n = 39) to complete 2 ApBM sessions weekly for 4 weeks. The control version prompted participants (n = 40) to complete a weekly sham-training task for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was number of standard drinks (10 g pure alcohol) consumed in week 4 of the intervention period, self-reported in the app. Secondary outcomes included past-week standard drinks at 8-week and 16-week follow-ups, past-week drinking days, past-week heavy drinking days (HDDs; days when ≥5 standard drinks were consumed) and questionnaire measures of AUD severity, quality of life and alcohol craving. Primary analyses followed an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach, with secondary complete-case sensitivity analyses also conducted for all outcomes. Groups did not statistically significantly differ in the primary outcome [values from ITT negative binomial model: ApBM = 75.49 standard drinks, control = 71.34 standard drinks, difference = 4.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -42.37 to 50.69, P = 0.859]. Most analyses of secondary outcomes showed statistically non-significant effects, with the only exception being past-week standard drinks at the 16-week follow-up, where ApBM participants showed statistically significantly larger decreases than controls in past-week standard drinks (reduction of 14.6, relative to baseline, versus 2.1 in controls; interaction β = -12.53, 95% CI = -23.85 to -1.22; P = 0.030). Time x group interaction effects were statistically non-significant for all other secondary outcomes (Ps > 0.069). A smartphone app using approach bias modification showed no evidence for reducing alcohol use among alcohol use disorder outpatients after 4 weeks, or evidence for effects on most secondary outcomes, although 16-week follow-up results suggested that approach bias modification may have facilitated delayed/longer-term reductions in alcohol use.

Patients' survival and quality of life are key factors in assessing value of treatments. However, limited evidence exists about the trajectory and key determinants of patients' health-related quality of life (QoL) following emergency abdominal surgery. Using the Enhanced Peri-Operative Care for High-risk patients study with measured QoL during eight months follow-up using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, we summarise the trajectory of patients' QoL after emergency abdominal surgery and use multivariable regression models to relate patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, pre-surgery characteristics, and time elapsed since surgery with their QoL. In further analysis we assess the contribution of post-surgery patient characteristics. Data from 686 patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery (50.4% female; mean age 66.6 (standard deviation (SD) 12.8) years; 50.1% with intestinal obstruction as indication for surgery), with QoL measurements were analysed. Shortly after surgery (mean days 7.59 (SD 7.48)), the mean EQ-5D-3L QoL utility score was 0.21 (SD 0.46), which improved among survivors to 0.74 (SD 0.31) in the medium- to long-term (i.e., three to eight months) following surgery. Patient's sex and preoperative risk of mortality were key determinants of QoL shortly after surgery. In addition to time since surgery, patient's sex, Charlson Comorbidity index, ASA physical status and indication for surgery were key pre-surgery predictors of QoL in the medium- to long-term post-surgery. From post-surgery characteristics, duration of hospital admission for index surgery and further days in hospital within 30 days prior to QoL measurement were key further determinants of QoL in the medium- to long-term. Individual patient, surgery, and recovery characteristics determine QoL post-emergency abdominal surgery and can help inform clinician-patient discussions and assessments of value of abdominal surgery interventions.

Adhesive materials are widely used in microvascular decompression for treating neurovascular compression syndromes. They play an important role in the critical step of vessel fixation. Recently, completely autologous ﬁbrin glue produced solely from a patient's own plasma was developed. It can theoretically reduce the risks of viral or prion transmission and allergic reactions, while potentially providing more stable long-term adhesion. This study reports our initial experience with completely autologous ﬁbrin glue in microvascular decompression and evaluates its efﬁcacy and safety. Twenty-seven consecutive patients (12 with trigeminal neuralgia and 15 with hemifacial spasm) underwent microvascular decompression using autologous fibrin glue, including 8 trigeminal neuralgia treated using a fully endoscopic supracerebellar infratentorial approach. Autologous cryoprecipitate and thrombin were prepared (average: 4.8 mL each) from preoperative blood collection (average: 388.9 mL) without adverse events. All offending arteries, including 5 vertebral arteries, were securely transposed using polytetrafluoroethylene and autologous ﬁbrin glue. The fibrin glue was also used to support dural closure with a collagen matrix. All patients experienced complete symptom relief, with no need for postoperative medication, except for 1 patient with mild recurrence despite maintained vascular fixation confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging. No new permanent neurological deficits, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, infections, allergic reactions, or systemic complications were observed. These findings suggest that completely autologous fibrin glue is safe and effective for both vessel fixation and dural sealing in microvascular decompression, without complications related to its use.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Chest-Compression-Synchronized-Ventilation (CCSV) using supraglottic airway devices (SGA) compared to tracheal intubation (TI) for ventilation during continuous resuscitation. In this cross-over study, the lungs of adult Thiel-embalmed cadavers were initially recruited using TI. Subsequently, various SGA (Laryngeal-Mask=Ambu®AuraGain™, Laryngeal-Tube=LTS-D®, i-gel-Laryngeal-Mask=I-GEL®) and TI were applied in randomized order during continuous chest compressions. CCSV was delivered with a CCSV-Pressure (pCCSV)=40mbar, PEEP=3mbar, respiratory-rate (RR) synchronized with the chest compression rate. The primary endpoint was achieving a pCCSV=40±3mbar. Secondary endpoints included pCCSV, expiratory tidal (Vte) 1ml/kgBW and leakage volumes (Vleak). Logistic regression models with random intercepts were used for the primary outcome, and linear mixed models were applied for secondary outcomes. Eleven cadavers were included. While two(18%) were successfully ventilated with all airway types, three(27%) could only be ventilated with an TI. Two cadavers(18%) could not be sufficiently ventilated with any of the airway devices including TI. When comparing TI and SGA, for TI a greater chance of reaching the target corridor of pCCSV (Odds Ratio(OR)=1.87;95%-Confidence-Interval(95%CI)=[0.91-3.83];P=0.0864) and a higher pCCSV was observed (regression-coefficient(RC)=2.99mbar;95%CI=[1.63-4.35];p<0.0001), along with a higher Vte (RC=42.42ml;95%CI=[32.07-52.27];p<0.0001), and a lower Vleak (RC=-55.03%;95%CI=[-62.92-47.15];p<0.0001). In comparisons among the individual SGA, lower pCCSV-values were observed for Ambu®AuraGain™ versus I-GEL® (RC=-2.58mbar; 95%CI=[-4.04--1.13];p=0.0006), Ambu®AuraGain™ versus LTS-D® (RC=-1.73mbar;95%CI=[-3.18--0.27];p=0.0204), and LTS-D® versus I-GEL® (RC=-0.86mbar;95%CI=[-2.30-0.59];p=0.2434). SGA were associated with a lower likelihood of reaching the target range of pCCSV, lower Vte, and higher Vleak. Regardless the airway device, CCSV-failure is possible emphasizing the need for vigilant respiratory monitoring REGISTRATION:: URL: https://www. gov Unique identifier number: NCT06306898.
40900210	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article;Review	Pain pathways and stem cells in endometriosis pathogenesis.	As a gynecological disease, endometriosis is a disease in which pain and inflammation are important parts. Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-related situation with a multifactorial etiology that remains incompletely understood. Endometriosis affects approximately 6-10% of females and is a prominent reason of infertility. Despite being histologically benign, endometriosis displays invasive behaviors and is associated with systemic inflammatory responses and immune dysfunction. In this text, endometriosis pathogenesis and pain associated with endometriosis is comprehensively explored with particular emphasis on inflammation, pain mechanisms and the emerging role of stem cells. Several theories, including coelomic metaplasia, lymphovascular dissemination, retrograde menstruation, and embryonic rest theory have been recommended to clarify the ectopic location of endometrial tissue. Among these, the immune-mediated inflammatory microenvironment and aberrant neurogenesis are considered in disease progression and the development of pain. The multifactorial nature of endometriosis-associated pain-encompassing inflammatory, neuropathic, and oxidative stress-related mechanisms-highlights the limitations of hormonal treatments and the necessity for new therapeutic perspectives. In this respect, the involvement of stem cells, particularly endometrial and mesenchymal stem cells, has attracted growing interest. These cells are implicated not only in the pathophysiology of the disease but also show promise in regenerative and immunomodulatory therapies. This review aims to present an integrative perspective on endometriosis by examining recent evidence on inflammatory signaling, neuroimmune alterations, and stem cell biology. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may open new avenues for personalized and multidisciplinary treatment strategies in endometriosis management.

Methadone treatment is effective for managing opioid use disorder (OUD) but raises concerns about its impact on cardiac function. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of cardiac dysfunction among individuals under methadone treatment. This cross-sectional study involved 200 OUD patients admitted to addiction treatment centers of Kerman, Iran, who were at least 1 year under methadone maintenance therapy. Participants were enrolled using a convenience sampling method. Exclusion criteria included concurrent alcohol or nonopioid drug abuse, underlying diseases affecting cardiac function (diabetes, hypertension, and chronic renal failure), hepatic diseases, or use of drugs affecting methadone metabolism. Data on methadone dose, treatment duration, and cardiac parameters assessed through echocardiography and electrocardiography were collected. A total of 200 OUD patients aged 46.34 ± 13.93 years (72% male) were included. The average duration of methadone use was 2.17 ± 1.34 years, and the average dose was 52.10 ± 27.46 mg/day. 38% of subjects had QT prolongation, while echocardiographic assessment revealed various cardiac abnormalities: 17.5% with systolic dysfunction, 12.5% with abnormal left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, 66.5% with diastolic dysfunction, and 15.5% with increased systolic pulmonary artery pressure. Significant correlations were observed between methadone dose and duration with all measured cardiac parameters. This study demonstrated an association between methadone treatment characteristics (higher dose and longer duration) and cardiac dysfunction. These findings suggest dose- and time-dependent cardiotoxic effects of methadone. Clinicians should implement cardiac monitoring, dose minimization, and risk-reduction strategies for patients on long-term methadone therapy.

This study aims to develop a robust, multi-task deep learning framework that integrates vessel segmentation and radiomic analysis for the automated classification of four retinal conditions- diabetic retinopathy (DR), hypertensive retinopathy (HR), papilledema, and normal fundus-using fundus images. AND. A total of 2,165 patients from eight medical centers were enrolled. Fundus images underwent standardized preprocessing including histogram equalization, normalization, resizing, and augmentation. Whole vessel and artery-vein segmentations were conducted using five deep learning models: U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, HRNet, and Swin-Unet. From the segmented vascular maps, 220 radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics and Mahotas toolkits. The arteriovenous ratio (AVR) was also computed from artery and vein masks. ICC analysis was used to assess reproducibility across centers, with features below ICC < 0.75 excluded. Feature selection was performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Mutual Information (MI). The combined AVR and radiomic features were input into four classifiers- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Random Forest (RF), and Ensemble. Models were trained and validated on stratified splits and externally tested on an independent cohort of 769 patients. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, area under curve (AUC), recall, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Swin-Unet outperformed all models with external Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 92.4% for whole vessel and 89.8% for artery-vein segmentation. Classification using the LASSO-Ensemble combination achieved test accuracy of 93.7%, external test accuracy of 92.3%, and AUC of 95.2%. AVR estimates were consistent with clinical expectations and contributed significantly to class discrimination. This multi-task pipeline demonstrates the potential of combining transformer-based segmentation with radiomics for accurate, interpretable retinal disease classification, showing strong generalizability for future clinical applications.

This study evaluates the impact of transitioning from video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) on patient outcomes and costs, based on the experience of a single surgeon at a quaternary center. We reviewed patients who underwent anatomic lung resections by a single surgeon between 2015 and 2022, excluding nonanatomic resections and those involving robotic bronchoscopy followed by resection. We compared baseline characteristics, short-term outcomes, and costs between the VATS (2015 to 2018) and robotic (2018 to 2022) groups. Charges were adjusted to 2023 dollars for comparison across different time periods. A total of 210 patients (140 robotic, 70 VATS) were analyzed, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Robotic surgery had a longer median procedure time (161 vs 145 min, P < 0.002). Length of stay was similar (5.3 ± 6.3 days for robotic vs 6.54 ± 7.5 days for VATS, P = 0.23), as were 30-day readmission rates (5% for robotic vs 5.7% for VATS, P = 0.83). Major complications occurred in 5 robotic and 5 VATS cases (P = 0.528). Adjusted direct charges were $40,250.40 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $34,739.0 to $45,761.8) for robotic and $44,124.00 (95% CI: $35,036.0 to $53,211.9) for VATS (P = 0.47). Total hospital charges were $74,199.00 (95% CI: $64,398.9 to $83,999.2) for robotic and $80,549.00 (95% CI: $63,028.9 to $98,069.3) for VATS (P = 0.498). Transitioning from VATS to RATS can be done safely without increasing costs or morbidity. In addition, the robotic approach demonstrated numerically lower charges, even during the surgeon's early learning curve. Hospital cost savings would be expected to increase as operative efficiency improves.

"Tree-based scan statistics (TBSS) are data mining methods that screen thousands of hierarchically related health outcomes to detect unsuspected adverse drug effects. TBSS traditionally analyze claims data with outcomes defined via diagnosis codes. TBSS have not been previously applied to rich clinical information in Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed approaches for integrating EHR data in TBSS analyses, including outcomes derived from natural language processing (NLP) applied to clinical notes and laboratory results, related via multipath hierarchical structures. We consider four settings that sequentially add sources of outcomes to the TBSS tree: 1) diagnosis code, 2) NLP-derived outcomes, 3) binary outcomes from lab results, and 4) continuous lab results. In a comparative cohort study involving second-generation sulfonylureas (SUs) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors among adults with type-2 diabetes, with an a priori expected signal of hypoglycemia, diagnosis code data showed no statistical alerts for inpatient or emergency department settings. Adding NLP-derived outcomes resulted in an alert for ""Headaches"" (p=0.047), a nonspecific symptom of hypoglycemia. Progressively adding binary and continuous lab results produced the same alert. Integrating EHR in TBSS can be useful for the detection of safety signals for further investigation."

Nutrition status significantly influences outcomes after solid organ transplantation, yet data on energy and protein intake in lung transplantation (LTx) patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are scarce. The objective is to examine the medical nutrition therapy and clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated post-LTx adults. This retrospective study (2022-2023) included adults post-LTx receiving mechanical ventilation admitted to the ICU. Clinical and nutrition parameters were recorded for the first 14 days of ICU stay. The Wilcoxon rank sum test or Fisher exact test were used to compare variables followed by a multivariate analysis to determine predictors of ICU length of stay (LOS). One hundred patients were included in this study: 65 (65%) were male with a median age of 65 years and body mass index of 26.3 kg/m2. Both ICU and total hospital LOS were prolonged in patients who received >1.2 g/kg/day of protein, but LOS was not affected by energy intake or nutrition status. There were no associations with mortality or infection rate. In a multivariate analysis, no individual main effect variable was significantly associated with ICU LOS. However, a significant interaction between protein intake and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Score (β = 0.0216; p = 0.0092) indicted that the effect of protein intake on ICU LOS is modified by illness severity. In critically ill post-LTx patients, higher protein intake was associated with a longer ICU and hospital LOS. This relationship appears to be influenced by illness severity, emphasizing the importance of individualized nutrition strategies in this high-risk population.

A subset of COVID-19 patients develops post-COVID-19 condition (PCC). This condition results in disability in numerous areas of patients' lives and a reduced health-related quality of life, with societal impact including work absences and increased healthcare utilization. There is a scarcity of models predicting PCC, especially those considering the severity of the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and incorporating long-term follow-up data. Therefore, we developed and internally validated a prediction model for PCC 2 years after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Data from the CORona Follow-Up (CORFU) study were used. This research initiative integrated data from multiple Dutch COVID-19 cohort studies. We utilized 2-year follow-up data collected via the questionnaires between October 1st of 2021 and December 31st of 2022. Participants were former COVID-19 patients, approximately 2-year post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Candidate predictors were selected based on literature and availability across cohorts. The outcome of interest was the prevalence of PCC at 2 years after the initial infection. Logistic regression with backward stepwise elimination identified significant predictors such as sex, BMI and initial disease severity. The model was internally validated using bootstrapping. Model performance was quantified as model fit, discrimination and calibration. In total 904 former COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis. The cohort included 146 (16.2%) non-hospitalized patients, 511 (56.5%) ward admitted patients, and 247 (27.3%) intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients. Of all participants, 551 (61.0%) participants suffered from PCC. We included 20 candidate predictors in the multivariable analysis. The final model, after backward elimination, identified sex, body mass index (BMI), ward admission, ICU admission, and comorbidities such as arrhythmia, asthma, angina pectoris, previous stroke, hernia, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis as predictors of post-COVID-19 condition. Nagelkerke's R-squared value for the model was 0.19. The optimism-adjusted AUC was 71.2%, and calibration was good across predicted probabilities. This internally validated prediction model demonstrated moderate discriminative ability to predict PCC 2 years after COVID-19 based on sex, BMI, initial disease severity, and a collection of comorbidities.

To assess racial/ethnic differences in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) prevalence in Hawai'i. This retrospective cross-sectional study included hospital deliveries at Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women and Children (Honolulu, Hawai'i) from 2009 to 2019. For birthing people with multiple deliveries during the study interval, only the last delivery was included. Birthing people with pregestational diabetes, delivery < 29 weeks, and multifetal gestations were excluded. GDM was identified through ICD-9 and -1 0 codes. Race and ethnicity were self-reported. Maternal body mass index (BMI) was recorded at delivery admission. GDM prevalence was determined for each race and the odds examined using logistic regression, also adjusting for maternal age and BMI. For analysis, three racial groups were sub-grouped into six ethnic categories as described: the three major racial groups were: (i) Asian, (ii) Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and (iii) White. Six major ethnic sub-categories in the Asian racial group included: East Asians-identified as (1) Chinese/Taiwanese, (2) Japanese/Okinawan, (3) South East Asians identified as Filipino, (4) Native Hawaiian and (5) Pacific Islander identified as Micronesian/Samoan, and (6) White. Of 57,031 deliveries, 31,663 were included in this study. Overall crude prevalence of GDM was estimated at 11.7%. The three Asian ethnic sub-categories had approximately twice the risk of GDM when compared to Whites (Filipina: OR 2.59, 95% CI = [2.27-2.96], Chinese/Taiwanese: OR = 2.38, 95% CI = [2.01-2.82], and Japanese/Okinawan: OR = 1.71, 95% CI = [1.47-1.99]). Native Hawaiians also had higher GDM prevalence estimates compared to Whites (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = [1.31-1.71]), though there was no significant difference for Pacific Islanders (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = [0.97-1.33]). Prevalence of GDM in hospitalized deliveries in Hawai'i's multi-ethnic population of women has increased nearly 2-fold in the last two decades. All Asian Americans remain at highest risk despite lower maternal BMI at delivery. NH women are younger yet have similar frequency of co-morbidities and comprise the largest proportion of GDM cases overall.

Dose accuracy in radiotherapy is crucial for treatment outcomes and patient safety. Ensuring dose accuracy allows for effective targeting of tumors while protecting surrounding healthy tissues. The quality assurance programs implemented worldwide by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are among the most effective methods to enhance dose reliability, particularly in developing countries. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the reliability of treatment doses applied in radiotherapy centers across Türkiye and to determine the impact of national dose control processes. The study, thoroughly analyzes dose accuracy in public, private, and university hospitals across six geographical regions of Türkiye. The study investigates whether the treatment doses administered by these centers comply with internationally accepted limits using the IAEA/WHO thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) audit standards. In these audits, the accuracy and consistency of the doses applied by each center were evaluated and compared with international standards. Among the 34 participating centers, 6% achieved dose deviations within ±1%, while 68% were within the widely accepted ±5% tolerance range. Notably, 26% of the centers exhibited deviations in the ±4%-5% band. Differences in dose accuracy were observed between center types and geographical regions. These results provide a snapshot of national performance and highlight areas for quality improvement. The results indicate that while dose reliability in Türkiye is generally within acceptable limits, deviations in some regions suggest the need for further standardization among centers. These findings underscore the importance of sustainable dose control processes at the national level and highlight their role in improving the quality of radiotherapy services in Türkiye. The study emphasizes that future dose calibration programs and training will further enhance dose accuracy across the country, contributing to safe and effective treatment for patients.

Listeria monocytogenes is a saprophytic bacterium and a foodborne pathogen of humans and animals. Little is known about its distribution and genetic diversity across different environments within the same geographical region. We conducted a large-scale longitudinal study in southeastern Spain monitoring Listeria spp. in untreated wastewater, ruminant farms, and natural environments over four seasons (N = 1490 samples, N = 545 isolates) and in food and food-processing environments (N = 7395 samples, N = 255 isolates). Listeria spp. were more abundant in host-associated than natural environments, and non-pathogenic Listeria were more prevalent than L. monocytogenes in both niches. L. monocytogenes was detected in 42.7%, 11.4%, 4.2%, and 3.4% of wastewater, ruminant farms, natural environments, and food-related samples, respectively. Hypervirulent lineage I accounted for 82.9% of L. monocytogenes isolates from wastewater, ruminant farms, and natural environments, while lineage II represented 74.1% in food-related samples. Among 255 L. monocytogenes cgMLST types, 5% were shared across environments, demonstrating circulation between different environments. Persistent L. monocytogenes clones were detected in food processing environments and ruminant farms. Our data suggest anthropogenic activities and livestock drive Listeria spp. dissemination. These results provide insights into the interactions of Listeria spp. in the environment, improving surveillance strategies to reduce pathogen transmission, food contamination, and clinical cases.

Armodafinil has been approved for treating excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in OSA patients who still experience EDS after adequately treated with CPAP. However, the effectiveness of armodafinil administration in OSA patients with suboptimal CPAP usage and persistent EDS remains unexplored. A 12-week prospective cohort study enrolled 33 moderate to severe OSA patients with suboptimal CPAP usage (2- < 4 h/night) who experienced EDS and were naïve to armodafinil. Patients received daily 150 mg of armodafinil and continued using CPAP. Efficacy and adverse events were evaluated. A total of 30 patients with mean age of 45.10 ± 10.74 years and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) of 13.93 ± 3.16 completed the study; however, one participant completed only the 8-week follow-up. After 12 weeks, ESS was significantly decreased by 5.03 ± 4.22 (p < 0.001). Clinical global impression (CGI) rated by investigators and by participants was significantly decreased by 1.79 ± 0.72 (p < 0.001) and 1.93 ± 0.75 (p < 0.001); respectively. Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was significantly decreased by 5.27 ± 2.93 (p < 0.001). The OSLER error index did not significantly improved (p = 0.61); however, a trend toward improvement was observed in patients with baseline psychomotor vigilance impairment (p = 0.17). While CPAP adherence showed no statistically significant change, there was a trend toward improvement from 2.99 ± 0.63 h/night at baseline to 3.47 ± 1.38 h/night (p = 0.09). No serious side effects were observed. In moderate to severe OSA patients with suboptimal CPAP usage who still experience EDS, administering armodafinil over 12 weeks period significantly improved EDS and sleep quality subjectively without compromising CPAP adherence. Armodafinil demonstrated excellent tolerability with self-limiting side effects.

Patients were divided into two groups. The patients who underwent A1 pulley release in group 1, and patients who underwent USSR in addition to A1 pulley release in group 2. Demographic characteristics, preoperativeerative Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Quick Disabilities Of The Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (qDASH), contracture degree, symptom duration, comorbidities, PIP joint tenderness, comorbidities, postoperative VAS and qDASH score information at the 6th month were obtained from the patient files. There were 13 male and 31 female patients in group 1 and 7 male and 24 female patients in group 2. The mean age was 61.67 years in group 1 (p = 0.506). PIP joint tenderness was present in 27 patients in group 1 and 37 patients in group 2 (p = 0.717). The average time from symptom onset to operation was 2.65 months in group 1 and 3.87 months in group 2 (p = 0.002). The mean preoperativeerative VAS was 3.34 in group 1 and 4.34 in group 2 (p = 0.001). The mean preoperativeerative qDASH score was 21.89 in group 1 and 25.14 in group 2 (p = 0.926). Preoperativeerative mean contracture degree was 17.02 degrees in group 1 and 22.18 degrees in group 2 (p = 0).  Conclusion: Higher preoperative VAS score, preoperativeerative symptom duration, PIP joint contracture and lower qDASH score lead to the need for USSR. Patients should be informed accordingly and surgery plans should be made accordingly.

Orthorexia nervosa is defined as an exaggerated and obsessive fixation on healthy eating. In recent years, there has been growing debate over whether orthorexia nervosa should be considered a new psychiatric disorder. This paper discusses the conceptual issues that emerge from the attempt to identify the diagnostic criteria for orthorexia nervosa as opposed to non-pathological cases of healthy eating or 'healthy orthorexia'. The analysis focuses on two main strategies that have been proposed in the literature: using physical impairment (malnutrition) and having recourse to the presence of psychological and psychosocial distress. The first strategy requires fundamental changes in the conceptualization of orthorexia nervosa, while the second risks unacceptably pathologizing uncommon lifestyles devoted to pursuing one specific activity, interest, or plan. Thus, substantial problems undermine the possibility of considering orthorexia nervosa, as it currently stands, as a plausible nosographic category. By proposing an analogy with eco-anxiety, the paper lastly shows that, if one accepts the widespread conceptualization of orthorexia nervosa, this behavior is better interpreted as an adaptive response than as a form of mental disorder.

CO2 electroreduction to produce fuels and chemicals is of great significance. Molecular catalysts offer valuable advantages in light of their well-defined active sites and tunable structural and electronic properties. However, their stability is often compromised by rigid conjugated structures. Herein, we proposed a hydrogen-bond regulation strategy that enables reversible structural deformation of metal phthalocyanines (MPcs) by incorporating methoxy groups into the phthalocyanine framework, thereby improving the flexibility and stability of MPcs. Calculations suggested that intermediate absorption induced structural deformation in MPcs. Moreover, hydrogen-bond interactions and conformational changes enriched with substituted methoxy groups in MPcs enhance structural flexibility. Operando Raman studies revealed that these hydrogen bonds correlated with the reversible structural deformation of NiPc. The optimized catalysts, facilitated by hydrogen bonds, achieved stable operation for over 500 h at 100 mA cm-2 with >98% Faradaic efficiency in CO2-to-CO electrocatalytic reduction, significantly outperforming molecular catalysts lacking appropriate hydrogen-bond interactions.

Depression and anxiety are prevalent comorbidities in individuals with chronic diseases, significantly impairing their quality of life and complicating disease management. Curcumin, derived from turmeric (Curcuma longa), has garnered attention for its potential therapeutic benefits in alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, its specific effects on depressive or anxiety symptoms associated with chronic diseases (DACD) remain unclear. This review aims to comprehensively evaluate curcumin's efficacy and underlying mechanisms through a meta-analysis of human clinical trials supplemented by findings from animal studies. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and OVID databases (until 25 October 2024), with PROSPERO registration number CRD42024602837. Fifteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,123 adult participants were included. Meta-analysis showed a statistically significant effect of curcumin on depressive symptoms (SMD: -0.65, P = 0.01, 95% CI: -1.16 to -0.13, I2 = 93%) and anxiety symptoms (SMD: -0.22, P = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.05, I2 = 0%). Preclinical studies identified several mechanistic pathways through which curcumin may alleviate DACD, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects via NF-κB, NLRP3, AKAP150/PKA/PP2B, miR-146a-5p/ERK, BDNF/TrkB, ROS-ERK1/2, GABA receptors, Keap1-Nrf2-ARE, and regulation of intestinal flora. These findings highlight curcumin's potential in alleviating DACD. However, the conclusions should be interpreted with caution due to considerable heterogeneity across studies, limited sample size, variations in curcumin formulations and dosages, and potential publication bias. Nevertheless, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current clinical and mechanistic evidence supporting curcumin's role as an adjunctive treatment for depression and anxiety associated with various chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, migraines, arthritis, coronary heart disease, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic syndromes. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024602837, identifier CRD42024602837.

Introduction: Postoperative pain management is complex and crucial in major gynecology oncological surgery. Currently, there is no well-defined standardized approach, resulting in significant variability in practices worldwide. This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of analgesic strategies used postoperatively in gynecological cancer surgery. Methods: A systematic review was conducted from inception to June 26th 2024 to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing pain management following any surgery for gynecological cancer. This was performed on the CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE databases. Results: A total of 46 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Of these 5316 patients, 1844 patients had cervical cancer, 99 had endometrial cancer, and 158 had ovarian cancer. The remaining 3215 participants had unspecified gynecological cancers or benign pathology. No studies focused on postoperative analgesia for vulval cancer. A meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity in study design, analgesic interventions (i.e., opioids, local anesthetics, paracetamol, NSAIDs, and holistic and complementary therapies), and multiple routes of administration (i.e., oral, parenteral, regional, neuraxial, local infiltration, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, patient-controlled, topical, and rectal). No single analgesic modality demonstrated clear superiority. The median Jadad score for methodological quality of the included trials was 4. Conclusions: The limited cancer-specific RCTs and diversity of analgesia modalities utilized reflect the wide range of applications. Postoperative pain is multifactorial and cannot be adequately managed with a single agent. National and international guidelines should aim to establish a standardized framework for postoperative pain management in gynecological cancers, ensuring accessible, evidence-based care that enhances both short- and long-term patient quality of life.

Colonic intussusception after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an uncommon, yet clinically significant complication. Therapeutic approaches for postoperative intussusception encompass conservative management, endoscopic reduction, and surgical intervention. We present a case involving a woman in her early 40s who experienced acute abdominal pain and fever shortly after ESD for a large ascending colonic adenoma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen confirmed intussusception without bowel ischemia. Immediate colonoscopic reduction was successfully performed, followed by conservative management. The patient achieved complete recovery with no recurrence at 3-month follow up. This case suggests that in patients developing post-ESD intussusception with no evidence of bowel necrosis or perforation, primary endoscopic intervention may be attempted and can be associated with favorable outcomes, potentially reducing the need for surgical management.

Stroke remains a leading cause of long-term disability worldwide, and early intervention is critical for optimizing neurorehabilitative outcomes by capitalizing on the heightened neuroplasticity of the acute and subacute phases. This study aimed to evaluate whether the integration of Radio Electric Asymmetric Conveyer (REAC) neurobiological modulation protocols, Neuro Postural Optimization (NPO) and Neuro Muscular Optimization (NMO), into early post-stroke rehabilitation can accelerate and enhance functional recovery compared to conventional rehabilitation alone. Thirteen patients (nine males, four females; age range: 56-86 years; mean: 74) received a single NPO session, followed by an intensive cycle of 10 NMO sessions distributed over five to six consecutive days. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using the Barthel Index (BI), the items from the mobility section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) motor function scale, and the assessment of functional dysmetria (FD). The REAC-treated cohort demonstrated marked improvements, with BI increasing from a mean of 33 to 68 and the items from the mobility section of the FMA from 9.0 to 17.3. FD, present in all patients at baseline, resolved completely after the NPO session and remained absent. A historical control group (n=13; 8 males, 5 females; age range: 56-94 years; mean: 76), matched for age and clinical condition, underwent standard rehabilitation without REAC interventions. This group showed more modest gains (BI from 36 to 67; items from the mobility section of the FMA from 8.9 to 15.3) despite a longer average hospitalization duration (34.4 days vs. 30.8 days in the REAC group). No adverse effects or complications were reported in the REAC-treated patients. These findings highlight the potential of REAC NPO and NMO protocols to support and enhance functional recovery when applied in the critical early stages of stroke rehabilitation. Further prospective controlled trials are warranted to validate these results and explore the mechanistic underpinnings of REAC-mediated neuromodulation in post-stroke recovery.

In the literature, there is a lack of data reporting tumor control rates after radiotherapy in actively growing vestibular schwannomas (VS). Data for this rarely studied population are needed. To estimate tumor control rates in radiologically growing VS treated with first-line radiotherapy. This international, multicenter cohort study used prospectively collected data from patients with growing unilateral VS treated first-line with radiotherapy between January 2000 and December 2023 from 8 tertiary referral skull base units. The data were analyzed in June 2025. Radiotherapy as an initial treatment for VS. The primary outcome was treatment failure, ie VS growth postradiotherapy, which was predefined as an increase in maximum intracranial tumor diameter (ICTD) of 3 mm or greater within the first 2 years after radiotherapy or 2 mm or greater thereafter. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure based on different definitions of VS growth: (1) an increase in ICTD of 2 mm or greater, (2) an increase in ICTD of 3 mm or greater, and (3) conversion to surgery. A total of 1883 patients (975 female individuals [51.8%]; median age at diagnosis, 63 years [IQR, 53-71 years]) were included in the study. Using the primary definition of treatment failure (an increase in ICTD of ≥3 mm within the first 2 years postradiotherapy or ≥2 mm thereafter), the Kaplan-Meier estimate yielded a 10-year tumor control rate of 76.1% (95% CI, 72.7%-79.2%). For secondary outcome definitions, 10-year tumor control rates were 60.1% (95% CI, 57.5%-64.3%) for an ICTD increase of 2 mm or greater, 78.3% (95% CI, 75.0%-81.2%) for an increase of 3 mm or greater, and 92.6% (95% CI, 90.4%-94.3%) for conversion to surgery. Neither pretreatment tumor size nor tumor location (intracanalicular vs extracanalicular) were significantly associated with treatment failure. The results of this cohort study provide tumor control outcomes for radiologically growing VS treated with radiotherapy using several clinically relevant definitions of growth. By focusing exclusively on this rarely isolated subgroup, the findings offer targeted data to potentially inform treatment expectations and future research.

To study the application of thrombolysis diagram (TEG) and routine coagulation test in the evaluation of coagulation function in patients with hepatic hydatid. The observation group consisted of 69 cases of hydatid liver patients undergoing elective combined segmenectomy, and the control group consisted of 69 healthy subjects. The correlation analysis of TEG, six coagulation items and PLT in the preoperative observation group and control group was conducted. The differences of TEG, hemagglutination six and PLT between the two groups were compared. TEG and coagulation function indexes of observation group were compared at different time during perioperative period. In the control group, The time of blood cell aggregation (K) was negatively correlated with prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (FIB) and platelet count(PLT); The maximum strength of blood clot (MA) was positively correlated with PT, FIB and PLT; The rate of blood cell aggregation (Angle) is positively correlated with PT, FIB and PLT; the comprehensive index of blood coagulation (CI) was positively correlated with FIB and PLT. The reaction time of blood coagulation (R) of observation group was positively correlated with PT; MA was positively correlated with PT, FIB and PLT; MA was negatively correlated with thrombin time (TT). activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer (DD), PLT, R value, K value, Angle, MA and CI were compared between the two groups, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). Compared with T1, APTT, R value, Angle and MA in observation group were significantly decreased at T2 and T3 (P<0.05); Compared with T1, PT, TT, FIB and K values had no significant changes (P>0.05). The coagulation function of liver hydatid patients was relatively low during the perioperative period, TEG is more sensitive to changes in perioperative coagulation function and can comprehensively understand the patient's coagulation state.

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) enhance patient-centered care but routine implementation in oncology settings remains challenging. This study seeks to explore patients' experiences with routine PROM integration within a health care setting with employed strategies to maximize uptake and inclusivity. A qualitative study employing a phenomenological approach was conducted at the National Cancer Centre Singapore. Seven breast cancer patients receiving routine screening using the Distress Thermometer and Problem List (DTPL) as part of a larger supportive care program were purposively sampled. Semi-structured interviews explored how implementation strategies influenced patients' experiences with PROM usability, accessibility, and perceived impact. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Participants perceived the DTPL as a meaningful PROM that validated their emotions but highlighted that presentation formats greatly influenced perceived simplicity of the tool. While multilingual and hybrid formats improved accessibility, digital literacy and cognitive burden remained as barriers. Education pamphlets provided initial awareness, but sustained engagement was impeded by a lack of time, reminders, and a conducive environment. PROMs were most useful during active treatment when symptoms fluctuated, yet frequent completion led to response fatigue. Timely responses to PROMs reinforced engagement, particularly when linked to referrals or symptom management. Some participants felt that formal PROM reviews by oncologists were unnecessary due to time constraints. Successful PROM implementation requires balancing simplicity, accessibility, and clinical relevance. Embedding PROMs within broader supportive care programs ensures clinical responsiveness and improves patient outcomes in oncology care.
40900942	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	In Situ Pulmonary Artery Thrombosis and Low Flow Stasis Artifact in Parenchymal Lung Disease: An Under-Recognized Phenomenon.	Pulmonary emboli (PE) are a common clinical problem seen when a peripheral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) migrates to the pulmonary arteries. However, emerging literature suggests that not all filling defects in the pulmonary arteries are the result of embolism, and that in situ pulmonary arterial thrombus (ISPAT) or low-flow stasis artifact (LFSA) within the pulmonary arteries can mimic acute PE. The proposed mechanism for ISPAT is chronic stasis due to abnormal perfusion in areas of parenchymal lung disease leading to in situ thrombosis. Similarly, LFSA occurs when stasis leads to persistent visualization of intravenous contrast which is then mistaken for thrombus. The clinical scenarios in which ISPAT and LFSA develop are not yet fully defined. We report here a series of patients with parenchymal lung disease leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch who likely had ISPAT or LFSA and not acute PE. Our aim is to further define parenchymal lung disease as a subgroup of patients who are at high risk for ISPAT. Cases initially diagnosed as acute PE leading to activation of the UCLA pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were all cases of PE that led to PERT activation. Inclusion criteria included absence of DVT, previously diagnosed pulmonary disease, and presence of thrombus only in areas of abnormal parenchyma. Cases were reviewed with radiology to identify cases in which ISPAT was the likely diagnosis, and five representative cases were selected to be discussed. These cases were then analyzed qualitatively for commonalities which are described below. The five representative cases described represent patients with known chronic lung disease who were diagnosed and initially managed as acute PE but, on review, met criteria for either ISPAT or stasis artifact. These cases, which were all rediagnosed as ISPAT or LFSA, were all seen in the absence of DVT, with thrombus specifically located in areas of significant parenchymal lung disease with suspected decrease in ventilation and perfusion in these areas. ISPAT or LFSA have been described in the literature, though its presence specifically in parenchymal lung disease has yet to be described. The authors recommend considering this diagnosis in patient's diagnosed with acute PE when the following are present: significant parenchymal lung disease, absence of DVT, absence of thrombus in the areas of the lung relatively spared of parenchymal lung disease, and suspected baseline decrease in both ventilation and perfusion to the affected areas of the lung. As this phenomenon may be physiologically beneficial, the authors suggest that not all cases of ISPAT or LFSA need anticoagulation, and that treatment should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Pectus excavatum is the most common congenital chest wall abnormality, with the Nuss procedure being the most commonly performed repair. Pain control is the predominant factor in the postoperative treatment of these patients. This study aims to compare the cost and outcomes of intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) and thoracic epidural (TE) in patients undergoing the Nuss procedure. A retrospective chart review was conducted at our institution for all patients who underwent the Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum from 2002 to 2020. Patients were stratified by pain management strategy, INC vs. TE. Chi-square and Fisher's exact were used to compare categorical variables. Wilcoxon tests were used to evaluate continuous variables and costs. A total of 158 patients were identified. Of these, 80.4% (N = 127) were treated with epidural, while 19.6% (N = 31) were treated with intercostal nerve cryoablation. The INC group had lower rates of PCA use (35.5% vs. 93.7%, p < 0.001), lower total morphine milligram equivalent requirement (27.0 vs. 290.8, p < 0.001), and shorter length of stay (3.2 days vs. 5.3 days, p < 0.001) compared to the TE group. INC was also associated with longer operative times (153.0 min vs. 89.0 min, p < 0.001). The total hospitalization cost for the INC group was higher compared to the TE group ($24,742.5 vs $21,621.9, p = 0.001). In patients undergoing the Nuss procedure, compared to thoracic epidural, INC was associated with lower opioid use and shorter length of stay but at the cost of longer operative time and increased hospitalization cost. Treatment Study, Level III.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is associated with complex structural changes in the myocardium, which may alter the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG is the initial test for patients with suspected heart disease. Electrocardiographic criteria for LVH diagnosis have a low sensitivity compared to the echocardiogram (ECHO). The advent of tele-ECG and the availability of automatic analysis systems have made the large-scale use of electrocardiography possible. However, there are only a few studies on the prevalence and prognosis of LVH automatically detected in the ECG. To evaluate the association between the Glasgow program score for LVH in the ECG and overall mortality in an electronic cohort of primary care patients in Brazil. Patients from the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) cohort, older than 18 years, who underwent digital ECG recording from 2010 to 2017, were included. The University of Glasgow Automated ECG Interpretation program was used to analyze the ECGs. ECG LVH was classified into definite LVH if the LVH-Glasgow score was≥6.3, probable LVH if the score was between 5.0 and 6.3, possible LVH if the score was between 4.0 and 5.0, and no LVH if the score was <4.0. To assess the relationship between the LVH-Glasgow score and mortality, Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities was used. The CODE database included 1,558,415 patients, with 1,389,331 patients over 18 years old. Technically unsatisfactory ECGs that could compromise the analysis were excluded. The Glasgow program automatically excludes the diagnosis of LVH if LBBB, WPW, or pacemaker rhythm have been detected before the tests for LVH are undertaken. The prevalence of an abnormal LVH-Glasgow score (≥4.0) was 18.5 %. At a median follow-up of 3.47 years, the general population's all-cause mortality rate was 2.68 %. After multivariate adjustment, the presence of definite LVH had a higher risk of overall mortality (95 % CI; HR 1.64 (1.59-1.69)); probable LVH (95 % CI; HR 1.18 (1. 14-1.23)) and possible LVH (95 % CI; HR 1.09 (1.05-1.13)) were also associated with increasing risk of death. The LVH-Glasgow score can be a prognostic tool in ECG analysis. In this population, a higher score was associated with a higher risk of overall mortality.

Complex changes of the innate and adaptive immune system occur in old age and contribute to the increased frequency and severity of infections in older adults. At the same time, chronic, subclinical inflammation occurs, which promotes age-related diseases. Age-associated changes in the immune system also influence the formation, growth and metastasis of malignant tumors. Furthermore, there are indications that the aging of the immune system contributes to the development of autoimmunity. Vaccinations are an important preventive measure for maintaining health and improving the quality of life, not only but especially in old age. The development of optimized and new vaccines for the older population has made great progress in recent years and decades; however, vaccination rates among older adults are well below target for all vaccinations.

Current approaches used for pediatric liver transplant (LT) surveillance have diagnostic limitations. We used pleximmune™ immune reactivity index (IRI) and anti-HLA donor specific antibody (DSA) to predict the adequacy of immunosuppression (IS) relative to risk of acute cellular rejection (ACR) at 1-year post LT. This is a retrospective chart review of children who underwent LT between January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2020, and had at least one pleximmuneTM measurement performed within 60-days of a liver biopsy. There were 45 liver biopsies with accompanying pleximmuneTM in 31 children. An inverse correlation was observed between tacrolimus level and IRI (R = -0.34; p = 0.039). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of IRI for diagnosis of ACR was 55 %, 65 %, 33 % and 81 % respectively. The combination of DSA and IRI had a specificity of 92 % and negative predictive value of 89 % for ACR. In conclusion, a high IRI identifies recipients with low tacrolimus levels. Thus, the associations observed in this non-standardized cohort support the use of pleximmuneTM IRI in combination with DSA, for hypothesis generation in future studies involving post liver transplant graft immune surveillance.

This study investigated the therapeutic effects of a composite small intestinal submucosa decellularized extracellular matrix/hyaluronic acid (HA)-incorporated thermosensitive hydrogel (HA-Gel) on interstitial cystitis (IC) in rats. The HA-Gel was fabricated using rabbit small intestinal submucosa-derived extracellular matrix as a thermosensitive scaffold combined with HA, and an IC rat model was established using the UPK3A65-84 peptide. Rats were divided into five groups: IC group, IC + HA group, IC + Gel group, IC + HA-Gel group, and a non-modeled control group. After 14 days of treatment, urodynamic analysis revealed that the HA, IC + Gel, and IC + HA-Gel groups exhibited significantly increased interval voiding times and maximum bladder capacities compared to the IC group, with the most pronounced improvement observed in the IC + HA-Gel group (p < 0.01). Histopathological evaluation revealed reduced mucosal edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and mucosal denudation in all treatment groups, particularly in the IC + HA-Gel group (p < 0.01). Mast cell infiltration was also markedly suppressed by HA-Gel (p < 0.01). Immunofluorescence and molecular analyses further indicated that HA, Gel, and HA-Gel effectively downregulated the expression levels of CD3, ICAM-1, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and TRPM8 in bladder tissues, with the most significant reductions observed in the IC + HA-Gel group (p < 0.01). Notably, both Gel and HA-Gel remained detectable in bladder tissues for over 14 days post-administration. In conclusion, HA-Gel not only improves voiding function and bladder capacity in IC rats but also suppresses inflammatory responses, demonstrating promising therapeutic potential and providing new insights for the clinical management of IC/bladder pain syndrome (BPS).

Liquid biopsies, particularly those involving circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patient blood, have emerged as crucial and minimally invasive adjuncts to standard tissue-based testing. ctDNA testing enables the identification of actionable mutations for targeted therapy and can be routinely used when tissue samples are unavailable for genotyping. Compared to tissue-based testing, ctDNA testing has the advantages of capturing spatial or temporal genomic heterogeneity and facilitating repeated assessments. The utility of liquid biopsies extends to multiple clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and minimal residual disease (MRD) detection. Numerous clinical trials are currently evaluating treatment strategies using ctDNA testing. In particular, the implementation of adjuvant treatment escalation or de-escalation based on MRD detection could dramatically transform future approaches to solid tumor treatment. Various ctDNA assays have been developed, and it is important to understand their strengths and weaknesses for effective clinical applications. Furthermore, ctDNA testing faces several technical challenges, including low sensitivity in detecting copy number alterations and fusions, as well as the possibility of detecting mutations associated with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the methodologies and recent advancements in cfDNA-based liquid biopsies for cancer patients, covering diagnosis, genomic profiling, and treatment monitoring. Furthermore, we explore clinical trial designs employing ctDNA testing and anticipate forthcoming changes in patient care.

A retrospective study was conducted on 1240 cases of cervical spine imaging data from 2018 to 2021 in the Radiology Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University. The distance between the uncinate process superior ridge and vertebral artery and the maximum of pedicle transverse angle, the minimum of pedicle transverse angle, the range of pedicle transverse angle and the pedicle width were measured according to age groups. The distance between the uncinate process superior ridge and vertebral artery increased with age. The maximum of pedicle transverse angle, the minimum of pedicle transverse angle and the range of pedicle transverse angle decreased with aging. The pedicle width increased with age and vertebral sequence. C3 and C7 showed significant differences in the distance between the uncinate process superior ridge and vertebral artery, the maximum of pedicle transverse angle and the minimum of pedicle transverse angle, the range of pedicle transverse angle and the pedicle width among age groups (P < 0.05). In the correlation analysis, age was positively correlated with the distance between the uncinate process superior ridge and vertebral artery (r = 0.13), pedicle width (r = 0.29), and negatively correlated with the maximum (r = - 0.06), minimum (r = - 0.03), and the range of pedicle transverse angle (r = - 0.05). The anatomical relationship between the uncinate process and the vertebral artery plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of vertebral artery type cervical spondylosis. Understanding the significant differences in the anatomical parameters of different segments between age groups, sequences and sides can ensure the safety of the operation. It can provide important theoretical basis and technical support for the imaging evaluation of vertebral artery type cervical spondylosis and the selection of screw Angle and screw diameter matching in anterior/posterior cervical surgery.

"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as promising candidates for combating drug-resistant pathogens and certain cancer types. However, their therapeutic applications are often limited by undesired hemolytic activity, while many AMPs exhibit only moderate potency. Herein, the ""helical wheel rotation"" strategy as a simple, cost-effective, and modular approach to optimize the pharmacological properties of amphipathic α-helical AMPs without altering their amino acid composition is explored. Using BP52 as a model peptide, six rotational variants (BP52-A1 to BP52-A6) and two sequence-modified derivatives (BP52-B1 and BP52-B2) are developed to assess their antimicrobial, anticancer, and hemolytic properties. Several derivatives, especially BP52-A6, exhibit enhanced antimicrobial activity and reduced hemolysis while maintaining or improving potency toward cancer cells. Importantly, all derivatives show substantially reduced hemolytic activity compared to BP52. These findings highlight the potential of helical wheel rotation as a valuable peptide engineering strategy to fine-tune selectivity and multifunctionality of AMPs for therapeutic applications."

Approximately 35% of individuals seeking abortion care use Medicaid for health insurance. Although the Hyde Amendment restricts use of federal funds for most abortions, states can supplement coverage using state funds. Understanding the scope of abortion coverage across states and potential barriers to access may help address health care inequities and inform interventions. To characterize state Medicaid abortion policies by conducting a qualitative analysis of publicly available state documents on Medicaid policy. This qualitative study analyzed Medicaid abortion policies across all 50 states and the District of Columbia (hereinafter, states). Data were systematically collected from publicly available Medicaid documents and state websites from May 2023 to February 2024. The main outcomes were key themes and descriptive statistics reporting on the scope of Medicaid abortion coverage and requirements for coverage across states, including documentation and procedures required of patients and physicians. Thematic analysis was performed to extract key themes found in abortion coverage policies, and descriptive statistics were used to show prevalence of identified themes across states. The analysis of 94 documents revealed 3 key themes. First, the scope of coverage across states was heterogeneous. Eighteen states aligned with the current wording of the Hyde Amendment, 10 states described life endangerment without use of current Hyde Amendment wording, 17 states outlined additional coverage for other specified conditions for abortions, 6 states covered all abortions, and 1 state's policy did not mention required federal coverage for rape or incest exceptions. Second, states imposed various patient restrictions and requirements with regard to abortion care coverage, with 22 states mandating reporting requirements for abortions due to rape or incest, along with other administrative hurdles for patients seeking care. Third, physicians were tasked with many responsibilities, such as determining eligibility for Medicaid abortion coverage and complying with documentation and administrative requirements. Thirty-eight states explicitly required physician certification and justification for clinical conditions warranting coverage. The findings of this qualitative study of state Medicaid abortion policies suggest that there is substantial heterogeneity among states regarding the scope of Medicaid abortion coverage and that there are numerous obstacles for patients and physicians in accessing this coverage. This heterogeneity and burden may impose an additional layer of complexity to abortion access. Measures and policies that improve transparency, clarity, and efficiency may enhance access to essential abortion care for vulnerable populations.

Sleep concerns are ubiquitous among people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) and result in significant morbidity. Over 80% of PwP experience sleep disturbances and about 33% to 40% of these patients report that sleep issues are one of their most significant concerns affecting their quality of life. PwP can suffer from one or more sleep issues and a multidisciplinary approach is often needed to help effectively improve quality of sleep and daytime function. Non-pharmacologic approaches to sleep dysfunction in Parkinson's disease include cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise and bespoke physical activity, mind body approaches, acupuncture, massage therapy, social connection, and light therapy.

Disseminated cancer can complicate the decision-making for major surgery, as patients can be poor surgical candidates and have potentially limited life expectancy. This study aimed to evaluate the 30-day postoperative outcomes of infrainguinal bypass in patients with disseminated cancer using a large-scale national database. Adult patients with and without disseminated cancer who underwent infrainguinal bypass were identified in the ACS-NSQIP database from 2011-2023. A 1:5 propensity-score matching was used to balance the preoperative factors. Thirty-day postoperative outcomes were compared. A separate multivariable analysis was also conducted. There were 25,200 patients who underwent infrainguinal bypass, where 120 (0.48%) patients had disseminated cancer, who were matched to 596 patients with no disseminated cancer. Patients with disseminated cancer had higher risks of mortality (13.33% vs 6.21%, p=0.01) and untreated loss of patency (5.83% vs 1.34%, p=0.01). Other thirty-day outcomes, including major amputation (5.41% vs 4.24%, p=0.61), cardiac complications (4.17% vs 5.54%, p=0.66), stroke (0.83% vs 0.84%, p=1.00), pulmonary complications (2.50% vs 6.71%, p=0.09), and renal complications (0.83% vs 2.35%, p=0.49), were comparable between patients with and without disseminated cancer. Multivariable analysis confirmed higher mortality and untreated loss of patency among disseminated cancer patients, while deep vein thrombosis was also found to be higher in this group (4.17% vs 0.96%, aOR 3.763, 95 CI 1.507-9.399, p<0.01). Disseminated cancer patients demonstrated more than twice the 30-day mortality risk and over four times the risk of untreated loss of patency. As such, infrainguinal bypass should be considered a high-risk procedure for disseminated cancer patients, and the clinical decision for surgery should be made with caution. DVT was also found to be higher among disseminated cancer patients after multivariable analysis, suggesting DVT prophylaxis among these patients may need to be optimized. Future studies should focus on the long-term prognosis, particularly limb outcomes, in disseminated cancer patients.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a broad spectrum of physical and cognitive impairments. Myeloid cells within the CNS, including microglia and border-associated macrophages, play a central role in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with MS. Activation of these cells contributes to the local inflammatory response and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells into the CNS. SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor that functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, capable of modulating immune cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signals. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SLAMF5 in CNS-resident and peripheral myeloid cells using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings demonstrate that both total and brain-specific SLAMF5 deficiency in myeloid cells leads to decreased expression of activation and costimulatory molecules, including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD80. This downregulation is mediated, at least in part, through the transcription factor BHLHE40 and its regulation of CD52, resulting in delayed onset and reduced progression of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of SLAMF5 in the brain halted disease progression and reduced the expression of myeloid activation markers. In human studies, SLAMF5 blockade in peripheral monocytes from MS patients and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52. Together, these results identify SLAMF5 as a key regulator of myeloid cell activation in neuroinflammation and suggest that it may represent a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders such as MS.

Physicians in Saudi Arabia encounter significant occupational stressors that elevate their risk of mental health challenges. This review maps research on the mental health of physicians in Saudi Arabia, identifies key themes and gaps, and contributes to understanding physician well-being. It aims to inform future research and targeted interventions to improve both physician well-being and healthcare quality. This scoping review mapped literature (2000-2024) on the mental health of physicians in Saudi Arabia. Inclusion criteria were primary research studies (quantitative or mixed methods) on the mental health of physician (interns to consultants) in Saudi Arabia. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched. Thematic synthesis was performed. Eighty-eight cross-sectional studies (sample size range: 55-1205; N ~11,000) revealed significant mental health challenges. Workplace bullying (70%, 95% CI: 65.2%-74.6%) and harassment (83.6%, 95% CI: 79.7%-87.0%) were prevalent. Psychiatric issues included high stress (>50%, 95% CI: varied according to study), depression (up to 75.8%, 95% CI: 70.2%-80.8% in residents), anxiety (up to 50%, 95% CI: 43.0%-57.0%), and sleep disturbances (up to 87%, 95% CI: 82.0%-91.1% in residents). Substance use (smoking 16%-47.7%) and self-prescription of psychotropics were observed. Adaptive coping (e.g., religion and planning) was common, while maladaptive coping (e.g., self-blame) was associated with higher stress, particularly in females. Job satisfaction varied, with lower satisfaction in intensive care and plastic surgery. This review highlights significant, interconnected mental health challenges among physicians in Saudi Arabia, particularly in high-stress specialties and among female physicians. Targeted interventions and future research are needed to address work-related stress, improve coping, enhance institutional support, and promote physician well-being and healthcare quality.

Microglia regulate neuronal circuit plasticity. Disrupting their homeostatic function has detrimental effects on neuronal circuit health. Neuroinflammation contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), with several microglial activation genes linked to increased risk for these conditions. Inflammatory microglia alter neuronal excitability, inducing metabolic strain. Interestingly, expression of APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, affects both microglial activation and neuronal excitability, highlighting the interplay between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal function. It remains unclear how microglial inflammatory state is conveyed to neurons to affect circuit function and whether APOE4 expression alters this intercellular communication. Here, we use a reductionist model of human iPSC-derived microglial and neuronal monocultures to dissect how the APOE genotype in each cell type independently contributes to microglial regulation of neuronal activity during inflammation. Conditioned media (CM) from LPS-stimulated microglia increased neuronal network activity, assessed by calcium imaging, with APOE4 microglial CM driving greater neuronal activity than APOE3 CM. Both APOE3 and APOE4 neurons increase network activity in response to CM treatments, while APOE4 neurons uniquely increase presynaptic puncta in response to APOE4 microglial CM. CM-derived exosomes from LPS-stimulated microglia can mediate increases to network activity. Finally, increased network activity is accompanied by increased lipid droplet (LD) metabolism, and blocking LD metabolism abolishes network activity. These findings illuminate how microglia-to-neuron communication drives inflammation-induced changes in neuronal circuit function, demonstrate a role for neuronal LDs in network activity, and support a potential mechanism through which APOE4 increases neuronal excitability.

Dengue and chikungunya are arboviral diseases with overlapping clinical characteristics. Dengue virus (DENV) is endemic in Colombia, and in 2014/2015, the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused an epidemic that resulted in over 350,000 cases. Since then, both viruses have been actively co-circulating. The early and accurate identification of pediatric infection caused by DENV or CHIKV is essential for proper medical management. Given that subsequent infections and co-infections with DENV and CHIKV have been reported, virological and immunological factors may influence their clinical outcomes. Here, we analyzed the viremia, antigenemia, and virus-specific antibody responses in hospitalized children suspected of having dengue during the peak of CHIKV infections in Colombia. Ninety-one children with a clinical diagnosis of dengue were included in the peak of the CHIKV epidemic (December 2014 to May 2015) at a reference healthcare center in Huila, south of Colombia. Multiplexed RT-qPCR for DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV was performed, and DENV antigenemia was evaluated using an ELISA for the NS1 antigen. Commercial capture or in-house indirect NS1-based ELISAs were used to assess circulating DENV and CHIKV-IgM and IgG. Clinical and laboratory characteristics were analyzed during hospitalization, and convalescent follow-up was conducted for a fraction of children. DENV and CHIKV monoinfections were confirmed in 54% and 12% of children, respectively, with the expected virus-specific seroconversion in recovery. Overlapping infections occurred in 22% of the children, while 12% showed no detectable DENV or CHIKV infections. Abdominal pain, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and thrombocytopenia were common findings associated with DENV, while arthralgia and rash characterized CHIKV monoinfections. One fatal secondary DENV-3 monoinfection was registered, and DENV infection dominated the symptoms of overlapping infections without producing different clinical outcomes compared to monoinfections. Thirty-eight percent of children were seropositive for CHIKV-IgG, indicating a significant burden of CHIKV infection in the pediatric population shortly after its introduction in Colombia. The previous virus-specific IgG serostatus did not impact the clinical outcome of the current heterotypic arboviral infection. The pediatric population in southern Colombia was rapidly exposed to CHIKV infections during the first months following its arrival, with up to 12% of hospitalized children suspected of having dengue experiencing CHIKV monoinfection, supporting that complex and dynamic epidemiological patterns may lead to delayed or missed diagnoses. The overlapping infections of DENV and CHIKV were frequent and did not lead to worse clinical or fatal outcomes.

Triple A syndrome (OMIM*231550) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, and neurological features. It is caused by functional impairment of the nucleoporin ALADIN due to mutations in the AAAS gene. Limited data exists on triple A syndrome from Sub-Saharan African and Arab countries. Our objective is to perform a comprehensive clinical and genetic study in Sudanese patients diagnosed with triple A syndrome. The clinical diagnoses were based on characteristic clinical and laboratory findings. Genetic testing was conducted in 20 families, encompassing 31 patients, revealing six different AAAS mutations. A previously described mutation in exon 9 (c.934C>T) was present in 35%, and the known Arabic founder mutation c.1331+1G>A (intron 14) was found in 30% of the families. In addition, two novel mutations, including an 8 bp-deletion at the exon 4/intron 4 junction (c.394_399+2delCTGTCTGT) and a 1 bp-deletion in exon 9 (c.852delG) were identified. Genotype-phenotype analyses highlighted significant variability in symptom occurrence, age of onset, and disease severity. Consistent with the high consanguinity rates in Sudan, most mutations (95%) occurred in a homozygous state. In conclusion, triple A syndrome is likely underdiagnosed in Sudan and exhibits significant variability in phenotypic presentation even among affected individuals within the same family or mutation.

Cox regression and treatment-effect were used, along with inverse-probability of treatment-weighting (IPTW) to adjust cohort treatment-assignment bias. Overall, 218 patients were enrolled. Median (q1-q3) age was 72 (56-78), 55% male. In 33% and 63% of cases, septic shock at presentation and C-BSIs by non-albicans strains were reported. Importantly, 68 (31%) patients received high dosage echinocandin (""HDE"": increase of 30-50% of standard dosage), according to clinical judgement. Eighty-two (38%) experienced TF; 90-day all-cause mortality was 30%, significantly higher in TF-group (p<0.001). At multivariable Cox-regression analysis, obesity, septic shock, and increased MIC to echinocandins were predictors of TF; presence of removable intravascular devices and HDE resulted protective. After adjustment by inverse-probability of treatment-weighting, HDE still reduced TF risk in patients admitted to the ICU, with SOFA score<6, BMI>30, or with serum albumin concentration ≤2,5gr/dL. Several clinical and microbiological factors could influence the echinocandin TF. Interestingly, in patients at risk for echinocandin TF, HDE may be protective."

Researchers have suggested that men with more masculine facial characteristics have stronger immune systems but are perceived to be less likely to invest resources in partners and offspring. How women resolve this putative trade-off between the costs and benefits of choosing a masculine mate have previously been reported to be associated with women's openness to uncommitted relationships (i.e., their sociosexuality) and self-perceived mate value. However, not all studies have reported these links and the methods used to assess masculinity preferences in studies reporting these patterns of results (forced-choice tests using stimuli in which masculinity was experimentally manipulated) have recently been criticized for having low ecological validity. Consequently, we tested whether sociosexuality or self-perceived mate value predicted women's masculinity preferences when masculinity preferences were assessed using ratings of individual natural (i.e., unmanipulated) male faces. Our analyses show no evidence that individual differences in women's sociosexuality or self-perceived mate value significantly predicted masculinity preferences. Thus, our results do not support the proposal that sociosexuality and/or self-perceived mate value are important sources of individual differences in women's preferences for male facial masculinity.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) typically requires hospitalization for intravenous (IV) corticosteroid treatment and monitoring. In response to the need to reduce inpatient stays, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient treatment models have gained interest. This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, and patient satisfaction of outpatient IV corticosteroid treatment for ASUC. We conducted a prospective cohort feasibility pilot study at a single academic center between May 2021 and October 2022. Fifteen adults with ASUC were enrolled and self-selected either outpatient or inpatient IV corticosteroid treatment. All participants received daily laboratory monitoring and symptom assessments for 14 days, with follow-up for 1 year. Primary outcomes included 90-day colectomy and 30-day readmission rates. Secondary outcomes included clinical activity scores, symptom and care satisfaction, and feasibility metrics. Ten patients received outpatient care, and 5 were hospitalized. No patients in either group required colectomy within 90 days. One outpatient and no inpatients required colectomy within 1 year. Thirty-day readmission occurred in 30% of outpatients and 40% of inpatients. Clinical activity scores and satisfaction with food and sleep were similar between groups at baseline and on day 14. Initial care satisfaction was lower in the outpatient group but equalized by day 14. Outpatient care required significant coordination but was successfully delivered without adverse safety outcomes. Outpatient IV corticosteroid treatment for select patients with ASUC is feasible, safe, and associated with comparable clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction compared to inpatient care. This model may offer a cost-effective alternative to hospitalization.

Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that can induce neuroplastic changes in the underlying intracortical areas. It has significant potential in clinical and research settings for modulating cognitive and motor performance. Little is known about how TBS affects oxygenations levels within and across brain hemispheres during stimulation of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC). This study aimed to investigate blood oxygenation levels in the DLPFC during TBS, using concurrent functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). 44 young adults completed within-subjects 2 × 2 design with 4 conditions that included intermittent TBS (iTBS), and continuous TBS (cTBS) stimulation applied to the left and right DLPFC. FNIRS was recorded concurrently, with 12 optode channels spanning across the left, medial and right prefrontal cortex. Findings focused on corrected significant effects that revealed clear neurovascular coupling during stimulation. Right hemisphere iTBS stimulation on the DLPFC resulted in excitation within and between hemispheres as expected, however left hemisphere stimulation decreased oxygenation levels both ipsilaterally and contralaterally. CTBS on the right and left hemisphere revealed reductions in HbO as expected in support of previous literature and potential LTD-like effects. This is the first study to show the extent and dispersion of blood-oxygenation changes in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres during excitatory and inhibitory TBS applied to the DLPFC. The findings demonstrate that TMS stimulation may originate from more global and interhemispheric effects, but that iTBS on the left-DLPFC induces decreases in oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO) providing the potential links for beneficial effects in cognition.

The objective is to evaluate the differences in the efficacy of wound care algorithms for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and venous leg ulcers (VLUs) treated by a mobile wound clinic. Most patients requiring home treatment performed worse with the standard of care (SOC) compared to those in traditional outpatient clinics, especially chronic wounds associated with multiple comorbidities. A retrospective chart review was conducted on one year's data from patient records of a mobile wound clinic (July 2022 - June 2023) involving patients suffering from DFU and VLU. Patients were divided into a control group receiving SOC with debridement and a group receiving SOC plus placental-based tissue grafts. The wound area and depth were assessed weekly. The SOC plus grafting group was monitored for the duration and number of graft applications per wound. Wounds were also scored for granulation-epithelialization (G+E) and eschar-slough (E+S). Statistical analysis included paired t-tests and ANOVA for multiple comparisons. In the interventional group, the average reduction in wound area was 39%, compared to a 10% reduction in the SOC with debridement cohort (p < 0.05). The average wound depth decreased by 33% in the interventional group and by 2% in the SOC with debridement cohort (p<0.05). The interventional group improved their positive wound scores by 8% (G+E), while negative wound scores decreased by 55% (E+S) compared to SOC with debridement patients. The mean grafting period was 94 days (±10 days) per patient, with a mean of 15 grafts (±2.6) applied per wound. Despite severe comorbidities, we observed improved wound healing in a home-based care setting for most DFU and VLU patients who underwent SOC with debridement and grafting compared to SOC with debridement alone. Patients receiving SOC alone showed poorer performance at home compared to those receiving SOC plus grafting, consistently showing improvement over time.

Twelve state Medicaid programs limit the monthly number of covered prescriptions. Such cap policies may force enrollees to forego essential medications with important health consequences. We aimed to determine the impact of cap policies on acute care use and all-cause mortality among enrollees with opioid use disorder (OUD). Using 2016-2019 T-MSIS Analytical Files, we propensity-score matched enrollees with OUD in 12 states with cap policies and 26 states without cap policies. Outcomes measured over 12 months included emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization, and all-cause mortality and were analyzed via generalized linear regression models. We conducted subgroup analyses by use of medications for OUD (MOUD) and comorbidity level and sensitivity analyses to examine the role of cap policy characteristics. Unadjusted risks were 64.0 % vs. 62.5 % for ED visits, 27.6 % vs. 27.5 % for hospitalizations, and 3.2 % vs. 2.7 % for mortality in cap states and non-cap states, respectively. After adjustment, hospitalization risk was higher (RR=1.89, 99.5 %CI:1.13,3.16) in cap states than non-cap states whereas ED visits and mortality did not differ. There were largely no outcome differences by cap status in subgroups. Strict prescription limits allowing 3-4 prescriptions monthly (RR=1.90, 95 %CI:1.09,3.30) and lack of MOUD exemptions (RR=2.23, 95 %CI:1.32,3.78) were associated with increased hospitalization risk relative to non-cap states. Medicaid prescription cap policies were associated with increased hospitalization risk, but there were no differences in ED use or all-cause mortality. Cap policies may undermine the health of individuals with OUD and could be counterproductive to state efforts to curb Medicaid spending.

This paper examines bioethical considerations of research conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where a notable scarcity persists in literature addressing region-specific bioethical issues. Although bioethics-related activities have encountered challenges surpassing existing protocol safeguards, emerging evidence demonstrates growing recognition of integrated scientific and ethical principles within African medical research. Maintaining research continuity in resource-limited settings necessitates bridging critical gaps between informed consent procedures and participants' actual understanding. This narrative review assesses progress, identifies persistent challenges, and outlines future directions for clinical trials and medical research in SSA, with particular focus on adherence to established bioethical standards and integration of local normative frameworks. Our analysis reveals a significant increase in publications featuring rigorous ethical discourse about bioethical research in Africa, with particular emphasis on SSA, in recent years. The review underscores substantial deficits in ethical conduct, including frequent non-compliance with fundamental principles: informed consent, autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Furthermore, we identify a paucity of evidence concerning methodologies to improve the efficacy and quality of ethical review mechanisms.

Many Arctic fishes experience prolonged periods of extreme cold and large thermal variation over both rapid and seasonal time scales which challenge critical physiological functions. In the central Canadian Arctic, we caught wild adult lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) acclimatized to winter and summer temperatures to determine the extent to which they seasonally adjust cardiac thermal performance and adrenergic control. We assessed the intrinsic and maximum heart rate (fHint and fHmax) of anaesthetised fish through cholinergic blockade and either adrenergic blockade (fHint) or stimulation (fHmax) during acute warming. Contrary to expectations, S. namaycush showed largely consistent heart rate responses to acute warming between seasons and adrenergic treatments. The fHmax increased with acute warming and reached a peak (peak fH) of 83 and 93 beats min-1 at temperatures (Tpeak) of 19.6 and 20°C and arrhythmia occurred at temperatures (Tarr) of 22.7 and 22.3°C in winter and summer, respectively. However, in the winter, adrenergic stimulation was important to achieve peak fH at high temperatures; adrenergic blockade in winter did not affect Tpeak (18.3°C) or Tarr (21°C) but lowered peak fH to only 68 beats min-1 (p < 0.05). Despite limited seasonal differences in fH, when compared at common, cool to moderate temperatures, winter acclimated fish did exhibit slower atrioventricular conduction (longer PR interval), slower ventricular depolarization (longer QRS duration) and a shorter overall systolic duration (lower QT interval). Overall, S. namaycush exhibited no seasonal plasticity in cardiac thermal tolerance and modest seasonal changes in adrenergic control at high temperatures and in cardiac electrical activity. This limited thermal plasticity may constrain their ability to cope with seasonally distinct thermal challenges including extreme heat events and increase their reliance on other coping or avoidance mechanisms when thermal refugia are available (e.g. behavioural thermoregulation). An increased need for avoidance behaviour could limit the accessibility of key habit for foraging and spawning which occurs in late summer in this region (Dubos et al., 2024).

Mendelian randomization (MR) has become an important technique for establishing causal relationships between risk factors and health outcomes. By using genetic variants as instrumental variables, it can mitigate bias due to confounding and reverse causation in observational studies. Current MR analyses have predominantly used common genetic variants as instruments, which represent only part of the genetic architecture of complex traits. Rare variants, which can have larger effect sizes and provide unique biological insights, have been understudied due to statistical and methodological challenges. We introduce MR-CARV, a novel framework integrating common and rare genetic variants in two-sample Mendelian randomization. This method leverages comprehensive genetic data made available by high-throughput sequencing technologies and large-scale consortia. Rare variants are aggregated into functional categories, such as gene-coding, gene-noncoding, and non-gene regions, by leveraging variant annotations and biological impact as weights. The effects of rare variant sets are then estimated with STAARpipeline and combined with the estimated effects of common variants by the existing MR methods. Simulation studies demonstrate that MR-CARV maintains robust type I error and achieves higher statistical power, with up to a 66.3% relative increase compared to existing methods only based on common variants. Consistent with these findings, application to real data on HDL-C and preeclampsia showed that MR-CARV(IVW) yielded a more precise and statistically significant effect estimate (-0.021, SE = 0.0101, P = 0.0365) than IVW using only common variants (-0.024, SE = 0.0123, P = 0.0538).

This study investigates the impact of a defined starter culture on the fermentation of cocoa beans and its influence on the production of volatile and non-volatile compounds related to sensory quality. A microbial consortium comprising Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia kudriavzevii, Levilactobacillus brevis, and Acetobacter okinawensis was selected based on their enzymatic activity and acid regulation properties. Fermentation trials showed that the starter culture enhanced the synthesis of key volatile compounds, particularly esters and higher alcohols, such as 2-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethyl acetate, which contribute floral and fruity aromas. Compared to artisanal fermentation, treatments with starter cultures exhibited lower levels of lactic and acetic acids and an increase in succinic acid, indicating a balanced acid profile and potential metabolic synergy between inoculated and native microbiota. The study also identified specific volatile compounds as potential biochemical markers to monitor fermentation progress. These findings support the application of functional starter cultures to standardize and improve cocoa fermentation, offering opportunities to enhance quality and value in small-scale production systems.

Predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) response to Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) can be challenging. Here, we assessed the value of a radiomics-based machine learning (ML) approach for predicting HCC response to SBRT, using pre-treatment and early post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This retrospective single-center study included 87 patients (M 67, mean age 65.3 ± 9.1y) with HCC treated with SBRT who underwent gadoxetate MRI both pre- and early post-treatment (around 9.5 weeks). Tumor radiomics features were extracted on pre- and post-SBRT MRIs on pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) [pre-contrast, arterial phase (AP), portal venous phase (PVP), transitional phase and hepatobiliary phase]. Long term response was assessed using modified RECIST criteria. Different ML models were developed based on 1st and 2nd order radiomics features to predict long-term objective response (partial and complete response) versus no response (stable and progressive disease). The cohort was randomly divided into training/validation (70 %) and testing 30 %. A total of 87 tumors were assessed (mean size 2.7 ± 1.6 cm). Objective long-term response was observed in 43 (49.4 %) patients. The best predictive outcomes were achieved using models combining pre- and early post-treatment radiomics, with top performing model combining pre-treatment T1WI-pre-contrast, pre-treatment T1WI-AP and post-treatment T1WI-PVP, achieving an AUC of 0.85 [95 % CI: 0.67---1], sensitivity of 0.7 and specificity of 1. Our initial findings show promising results for ML radiomics in predicting long-term response of HCC to SBRT, which may have implications for management decisions.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become one of the major health burdens in the world with high mortality rates, especially at the advanced stages. The C-reactive protein (CRP)-albumin-lymphocyte (CALLY) index is a novel multidimensional biomarker combining systemic inflammation, nutritional status, and immune function. This study evaluated the association between the CALLY index and overall survival (OS) as well as recurrence-free survival (RFS) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, the medical characteristics of 1447 CRC patients who were treated at one of the medical centers affiliated with two universities of medical sciences between 2012 and 2022 were examined. Patients were divided into two groups based on the CALLY index: ≥ 2 (945 patients) and < 2 (502 patients). Demographic characteristics, tumor characteristics, and pathological findings of the patients were extracted by referring to the patient records. The 5-year OS rate for patients with a CALLY index ≥ 2 was 80.3%, compared to 64.9% for those with a CALLY index < 2 (log-rank test = 68.2, P = 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that the CALLY index was significantly associated with OS rate of patients, and OS rate was significantly higher in patients with a CALLY index ≥ 2 than in patients with a CALLY index < 2 (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.95, P = 0.001). Also, based on these results, the patients' age, mean BMI, tumor size, T stage, TNM stage, presence of metastasis, tumor location, number of involved lymph nodes, colon diseases, adjuvant chemotherapy, platelet level, and pathological tumor differentiation were all significantly associated with survival in CRC patients (P < 0.05). Our study demonstrated that a higher CALLY index is significantly correlated with improved survival outcomes and a reduced risk of recurrence in CRC patients. CALLY index can be helpful as a criterion for predicting the prognosis of patients with CRC.

"Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) at risk of HIV frequently have symptoms of common mental disorders (CMDs), which are associated with lower pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence. We conducted a pilot hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial (CHOMA) to evaluate whether an evidence-based mental health intervention adapted for PrEP delivery (""Youth Friendship Bench SA"") could address CMD and PrEP adherence among South African AGYW. CHOMA was conducted in Johannesburg from April 2023 to February 2024. We enrolled AGYW (18-25 years) who were already on or willing to initiate PrEP and had CMD symptoms (Self-Reporting Questionnaire 20-item [SRQ-20]≥7). Participants were randomized to our Youth Friendship Bench SA intervention (five problem-solving sessions with a lay counsellor, one group session) or standard-of-care CMD services (brief CMD assessment, referral). Counselling sessions occurred at enrolment and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. Co-primary outcomes were PrEP adherence (positive result on a urine tenofovir assay) and reduced CMD symptoms (SRQ-20<7) at Week 12 and, secondarily, Week 4. We used Poisson regression to assess intervention effects and summarized responses to three validated scales assessing intervention acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility (ranges: 1-4). Of 116 AGYW enrolled, the median SRQ-20 score was 9. We retained 69% through Week 12. Of 57 intervention participants, 64.9% (N = 37) received four or more sessions. At Week 4, 29/36 (80.6%) participants in the intervention and 25/41 (61.0%) in the standard-of-care had recent PrEP use (RR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.03-1.89; p = 0.03), but this was not sustained through Week 12 (RR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.64-1.22; p = 0.44). Enrolment SRQ-20 score was not associated with Week 12 PrEP adherence or retention. CMD symptoms did not differ by arm at Week 4 or 12, although the proportion with SRQ-20 scores >7 decreased overall between Weeks 4 (54.5%, 42/77) and 12 (35.0%, 28/80; p = 0.02). Median acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility scores were 3.50, 3.75 and 3.25, respectively. The intervention improved PrEP adherence at Week 4, although the effect was not durable to Week 12, possibly due to retention challenges. Reductions in CMD symptoms were seen in both arms. Findings suggest different mental health and PrEP support interventions may be needed to improve integrated service delivery among AGYW."

The goals of treatment for people with advanced cancer are to prolong survival and improve symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although many phase 3 randomised clinical trials seek to evaluate HRQOL during treatment, informing individual patients about expected HRQOL outcomes is challenging, as the common method of analysis and reporting compares averages for randomised groups, and clinicians find these data difficult to apply in clinical practice. Symptomatic patients with advanced cancer would like to know the probability that a proposed treatment might improve their survival or their dominant symptoms, and the probability of having treatment-related side-effects. When specifying HRQOL endpoints, we recommend that trialists develop HRQOL hypotheses about which dominant symptoms might be improved due to the initiation of the investigational treatment, and whether aspects of functioning and overall HRQOL will also improve despite the side-effects of the treatment. Validated, disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measures should be used to assess the relevant HRQOL concepts. Changes in HRQOL should be reported as the proportion of patients who have a specified improvement (or deterioration) in these relevant HRQOL scales (ie, as a response criterion), and harmonised standards for such a response criterion are needed.

Diverticular diseases uncommonly occur at a young age. However, its prevalence in younger individuals is rising. Atypical presentations will lead to misdiagnoses and unindicated surgery. Colovesical fistulas remain the most common type that is associated with diverticular diseases. A 16-year-old female patient presents with 2 months history of left-sided lower abdominal pain, in addition to, longstanding history of urinary incontinence since early childhood. Imaging studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, revealed complicated sigmoid diverticulitis by fistula formation to the urinary bladder and uterus, possible fistula to the vagina and rectum. The patient underwent successful surgical intervention, including sigmoidectomy, closure down of the colovesical fistula, and keeping of the vesicouterine fistula with plans for future repair by a specialized urogynecologist.

Type I interferons (IFNs) are critical cytokines for antiviral defense and are linked to painful diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and neuropathic pain in humans. IFN-α therapy can cause myalgia, headache, joint and abdominal pain. Studies in rodent models demonstrate that direct action of IFNs on sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) promotes hyperexcitability but rodent behavioral data on IFNs are conflicting, with reports of both pro- and anti-nociceptive actions. We sought to clarify the action of IFN-α and IFN-β on human DRG (hDRG) nociceptors. We found that IFN receptor subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are expressed by these neurons and their engagement induces canonical STAT1 signaling and non-canonical MAPK activation as measured by increased phosphorylation of the cap-binding protein eIF4E by MNK1/2 kinases. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, Ca2+-imaging, and multi-electrode arrays we demonstrate that IFN-α and -β increase the excitability of hDRG neurons with acute and long-term exposure. Type I IFNs prolong the duration of capsaicin responses, an effect that is blocked by inhibition of MNK1/2 with eFT508, a specific inhibitor of these kinases. This study supports the conclusion that type I IFNs induce hyperexcitability and TRPV1-sensitization when they interact with IFNAR1/2 in hDRG nociceptors.

Approximately 10-30 % of the youth (aged 15-24) have a diagnosed chronic medical condition. Effective transition from pediatric to adult care is thus essential for disease management. The growing interest in the transition of young people with chronic medical conditions has led to numerous international studies revealing diverse and often inadequate transition practices. Thus, the aim was to gain a new understanding and deeper insight into youths´ experiences of their transition from paediatric to adult care. Utilizing the meta-ethnographic method by Noblit and Hare, a structured literature searchwas conducted in CINAHL and PubMed. Ten articles were included. The meta-ethnography found that youth - despite their chronic medical condition - define themselves as primarily young and secondarily chronically ill. Furthermore, youth transitioning to adult care are being the Captain of Their Own Life and hence stand alone with the responsibility of managing their illness, lacking the competence to master it fully, and facing an unorganized healthcare system that does not adequately support their needs. Thus, youth find they are Navigating in the Dark. Adopting a rigorously systematic approach to conducting a meta-ethnography provides new and valuable knowledge into the transition process from pediatric to adult care. Youth with chronic medical conditions encounter multiple challenges in their transition from pediatric to adult care, which has not systematically been integrated into patient care pathways in clinical practice. This review provides a new understanding of youths' transition experiences, on which further research regarding the organization of effective and evidence-based process can be based.

Bisphenol A (BPA), a synthetic organic compound widely used in plastic products, toys, water pipes, and flame retardants, has been linked to the onset and progression of various cancers. This study explores the association between BPA and bladder cancer using bioinformatics approaches. We applied the ssGSEA algorithm to calculate BPA-related scores in TCGA-BLCA cohort and classify patients based on this. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses identified key pathways associated with BPA-related genes. Prognostic genes were screened through differential expression, Cox regression, and Lasso regression, leading to the construction of a prognostic model. Pathway enrichment suggested that BPA exposure promotes bladder cancer progression by modulating the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition pathway. In vitro experiments demonstrated that exposure to 10⁻⁷ μM BPA significantly enhanced the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells, with Western blot confirming that BPA induces the EMT phenotype in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest the involvement of the BPA-mediated regulatory network in bladder cancer progression, thereby providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying BPA-induced bladder cancer development upon environmental exposure.

"Demodex eyelash mites are increasingly associated with eye and skin inflammation in humans, and cause demodectic mange in mammals. Informal accounts of symptom improvement and reduced need for anti-allergy medicines, when Demodex reproduction is prevented, indicate a further role linking Demodex to rhinitis, asthma and dermatitis. Their mobility, allergenic debris and consequential immunological impact may also explain progression of allergies in the ""allergic march"". Being photophobic and nocturnal, Demodex folliculorum shelter, feed, and sleep in eyelash follicles during daylight. Coston (1967) speculated that Demodex emerge to mate during darkness and observed that medicated ointments rubbed into the eyelid margins at bedtime treated Demodex blepharitis effectively, presumably by preventing mating. Sixteen cases are described retrospectively whereby interested volunteers adopted Coston's technique, using unmedicated petroleum jelly. To break the lifecycle, a minimum 28-day course was advised, though concordance varied. Fourteen people reported relief from a surprising range of symptoms including not only dry eye and blepharitis but also rhinitis, asthma, angioedema and seborrhoeic dermatitis. Analysis of GP prescribing data in three volunteers allowed comparison of five-year periods immediately before and after starting continuous treatment. Mean yearly issues of anti-allergy and antimicrobial medicines reduced from 15.6 (range 8-25) to 1.8 (range 0-4), representing an 88.5% decrease for Volunteer 1 and from 5.8 (range 3-9) and 14.2 issues (range 9-24) to zero for both Volunteer 2 and Volunteer 13 respectively, representing 100% reductions in prescribing. Exacerbations of acne and dermatitis in two cases illustrate possible Demodex involvement in common dermatoses. This account is limited by its informal and retrospective nature in a disparate cohort, without assessment of Demodex levels. These preliminary observations support the hypothesis that Demodex allergens may trigger facial, ocular and respiratory inflammation and that reducing mite count with petroleum jelly improves symptoms. Formal clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis."

Titanium is widely used for dental implant abutments due to its mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and corrosion resistance; however, its gray coloration can compromise esthetic outcomes, particularly in patients with thin or translucent gingival biotypes. Anodization, a surface modification technique altering the titanium oxide layer, has been proposed to improve soft tissue aesthetics by producing abutments with warmer tones (eg, pink or gold) that harmonize with the surrounding gingiva. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the clinical and aesthetic outcomes of anodized titanium abutments compared to non-anodized titanium and other materials, with a focus on peri-implant soft tissue health and visual integration. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in Scopus, PubMed, and ScienceDirect for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) published between 2013 and 2024. Eligibility followed the PICOS framework. Nine RCTs with parallel or split-mouth designs and follow-ups from six weeks to two years were included. Esthetic outcomes were assessed using CIELab spectrophotometry and the Pink Esthetic Score (PES), while clinical parameters included mucosal recession, probing depth, plaque accumulation, gingival inflammation, and bleeding on probing. Study quality was appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Anodized titanium abutments demonstrated enhanced aesthetic outcomes, especially in thin gingival biotypes, by improving colour harmony and reducing grayish shine-through. Pink-anodized abutments also showed better soft tissue integration compared to controls. However, clinical improvements such as reductions in inflammation, plaque, or recession were modest, inconsistent, and often statistically insignificant across studies. While anodization appears safe and beneficial for visual outcomes, its functional clinical advantages remain uncertain. These findings call for cautious interpretation and highlight the need for further well-powered, standardized long-term RCTs to validate the broader clinical relevance.

"Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid, is used by athletes to enhance recovery and manage other conditions (e.g., poor sleep, anxiety). Although CBD is not prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), other cannabinoids found in ""broad-spectrum"" CBD products (e.g., cannabigerol (CBG), cannabidivarin (CBDV)), remain prohibited. This study aimed to determine whether 10-weeks' use of a broad-spectrum CBD product (150 mg.day [containing trace concentrations of CBG]) could lead to detectable concentrations of prohibited cannabinoids in urine and plasma. The influence of moderate-intensity exercise was also assessed. Thirty-six healthy individuals (47% male) self-administered either a broad-spectrum CBD product (n = 31; CBD) or a visually identical placebo (n = 5; PLA) for 10-weeks. After 10-weeks, participants completed a fasted, 90-minute bout of moderate-intensity exercise (55% VO2peak). Blood and urine samples were collected at baseline (pre-supplementation) and pre- and post-exercise. No cannabinoids or metabolites were detected at baseline in either the PLA or CBD group. Following 10-weeks of supplementation, urinary concentrations of CBD and its metabolites (6-OH-CBD, 7-COOH-CBD, 7-OH-CBD) were present. CBG and CBDV were also detected in 42% and 68% of pre-exercise samples, respectively. Urinary concentrations of 6-OH-CBD (P = 0.006), 7-OH-CBD (P = 0.009), CBD (P = 0.043), CBG (P = 0.0023) and CBDV (P = 0.033) also increased from pre- to post-exercise. CBG and CBDV were detected in 74% and 84% of post-exercise samples, respectively. Concentrations of ∆9-THC or its metabolites (11-OH-THC, 11-COOH-THC) were not present at any timepoint. Daily use of a broad-spectrum CBD supplement resulted in detectable urinary concentrations of WADA-prohibited cannabinoids in urine. Exercise appeared to increase concentrations of these cannabinoids. Therefore, athletes should avoid consuming broad-spectrum CBD products, given the potential associated anti-doping risks."

Individuals admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to cancer frequently encounter cognitive impairment and alterations in their mental health, which engenders psychological distress and considerably impacts their quality of life. In Mexico, there is an imperative for valid and reliable clinical tools to identify these symptoms, to providing timely and appropriate psychological intervention. To determine the psychometric properties of the Intensive Care Psychological Assessment Tool (IPAT) in a Mexican population with cancer discharged from ICU. A cross-sectional instrumental design with non-probability convenience sampling was employed. Data were collected between February 2023 and October 2024 with 75 people discharged from the ICU. Factor structure (confirmatory factor analysis), reliability (internal consistency), measurement invariance, and criteria validity (convergent, discriminant, and known-groups) were assessed. Patients were assessed during oncological hospitalization, following ICU. The participants were predominantly male, residing in the interior of the country, with an average age of 44 years (range 19-78, SD 16.21). Internal consistency results were deemed to be satisfactory (α = 0.78) for 9 items. The CFA indices were adequate [χ2 (gl) 27.436 (24), CMIN/DF 1.143, CFI 0.96, GFI 0.97, SRMR 0.036, RMSEA 0.044] as were the scalar invariance indices for invasive mechanical ventilation [CFI = 0.871; RMSEA = 0.058; χ2/gl = 20.519 (10)] and for gender, restricted invariance indices [CFI = 0.849; RMSEA = 0.068; χ2/gl = 23.302 (12)]. The Mexican version of the IPAT for people with cancer is a valid and reliable tool for use in oncology and critical care settings in Mexico. It is recommended for use at the time of discharge from the ICU, as it allows the identification of psychological distress for timely intervention. For future considerations, diverse clinical settings and patient populations should be explored to enhance the tool's applicability and generalizability in the varied contexts of cancer in ICU.

Taste and smell disorders are more common in individuals with diabetes, particularly among those with low insulin sensitivity or central obesity. These disorders may affect glycaemic control by altering dietary habits. This study aimed to investigate self-reported taste and smell dysfunction in individuals with diabetes and explore associations with clinical and behavioural factors. We examined self-reported taste and smell disorders in 47,011 individuals with or without diabetes using data from the Health in Central Denmark (HICD) cohort. In total, eight questions on subjective smell and taste function were included in the questionnaire. Participants with type 2 diabetes reported significantly more qualitative and quantitative chemosensory complaints than matched controls. In contrast, no significant differences were found between individuals with Type 1 Diabetes and controls. Smoking was consistently associated with increased complaints across all groups, while HbA1c levels showed no correlation with taste or smell disorders. Obesity, particularly in women with diabetes, was linked to higher symptom reporting CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with type 2 diabetes report more chemosensory complaints than controls. Smoking and obesity, but not HbA1c, were associated with a higher prevalence of symptoms. As subjective rating tends to underestimate true prevalence, future research should include objective testing to clarify how chemosensory disorders affect dietary behaviour and diabetes management.

To assess the clinical service provision of neonatal follow-up services in the UK in line with UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline NG72, 'Developmental follow-up of children and young people born preterm'. Design: Online survey. Neonatal units in England, Scotland and Wales (n = 187) in July- September 2022. Lead neonatal clinicians for neurodevelopmental follow-up. Responses were received from 154 neonatal units, representing 82% of the total. This included 52 out of 58 (89%) Neonatal Intensive Care Units, 68 out of 86 (79%) Local Neonatal Units, and 34 out of 43 (79%) Special Care Baby Units. In total, 136 units (88%) provided neurodevelopmental follow-up for infants born before 30 weeks' gestation, and 75 units (51%) did so for those born before 32 weeks' gestation. Out of 145 responses, 134 units (92%) offered follow-up to infants with brain injury requiring cooling therapy. A 2-year neurodevelopmental face-to-face appointment was available for infants born before 30 weeks' gestation in 129 units (83%), while only ten units (6%) provided a 4-year assessment for those born before 28 weeks' gestation. Additionally, just 13 units (9.6%) directed families to peer support services. The structure and content of neonatal neurodevelopmental follow-up vary widely. Notably, there is a lack of 4-year assessments for infants born preterm, representing a missed opportunity to support school readiness. What is already known on this topic? Neonatal neurodevelopmental follow-up is a vital aspect of care for early detection of difficulties, timely access to intervention, promotion of long-term health and wellbeing and data collection to contribute to parental counselling. Delivery of neonatal follow-up in line with UK clinical guidelines has not been evaluated. What this study hopes to add. There is wide variation in the inclusion criteria, content, and duration of neonatal neurodevelopmental follow-up in the UK. Only 6.8% of services reported offering infants born < 28 weeks' gestation a face-to-face appointment at four years of age. Recognition that the informational needs of parents may be conflated with the data requirements of clinicians, and this may contribute to suboptimal clinical service provision and limited reliable outcome data. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy. This study highlights the lack of neurodevelopmental surveillance and support for children born < 28 weeks' gestation at four years of age. These data provide evidence for Operational Delivery Networks (ODNs) to understand how neonatal neurodevelopmental follow-up is delivered within their area. This will help inform families about available services, facilitate joint work, and deliver more equitable neonatal follow-up in the UK. Clinicians could improve information sharing with families by signposting to trusted local, community, online, or third-sector support. Further research is necessary to comprehensively understand neonatal and paediatric developmental services from a parent/caregiver perspective and a systems and processes perspective. Clinical policy and guidelines should provide further clarity regarding which services are most appropriate and responsible for delivering this care.

Frozen shoulder is a condition that causes pain, stiffness, and loss of range of motion. However, little is known regarding the need for intra-articular corticosteroid injections for this condition, as well as the association between known risk factors and the need for these injections. To evaluate the relationship between known risk factors and the need for intra-articular corticosteroid injections in patients with adhesive capsulitis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess the association between risk factors for adhesive capsulitis and the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections in patients treated between January and December 2022. All patients diagnosed with primary adhesive capsulitis were included. Comparative analysis between steroid users and non-users was performed using chi-square tests and linear model ANOVA variance, based on the data type and distribution. A binary logistic regression model was used to evaluate whether demographics and comorbidities predicted corticosteroid injection use. In total, 138 patients were diagnosed with primary adhesive capsulitis. Patients were divided into two groups according to the need for intra-articular corticosteroid injections. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups regarding laterality, age, sex, hypothyroidism, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and other risk factors. None of the investigated factors predicted the need for intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Further research is needed to explore other potential influences and improve treatment decision-making for adhesive capsulitis.

Wilson disease (WD), an inherited copper metabolism disorder, is linked to hepatic injury from copper accumulation-induced dyslipidemia. Children with WD have a high incidence of dyslipidemia, yet personalized risk assessment tools are lacking. This study established a predictive nomogram to provide foundational evidence for early detection in this population. In this retrospective cohort study, clinical data from 913 children with WD were retrospectively collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Chinese Medicine (November 2018-February 2025). The cohort was stratified by age group and dyslipidemic status using stratified random sampling, resulting in a division into a training set (70%, n = 641) and a validation set (30%, n = 272). Independent risk factors were identified using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The nomogram prediction model was constructed and validated internally. The model's discriminatory efficacy was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves with the area under the curve (AUC), while its calibration performance was assessed using calibration curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Furthermore, the clinical utility of the model was examined through decision curve analysis and clinical impact curves. The prevalence of dyslipidemia was 68.24%. The nomogram incorporated six significant clinical variables: age group (≥ 10 years vs. < 10 years), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), homocysteine (Hcy), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and platelet count (PLT). The prediction model demonstrated good discrimination (AUC: 0.810 in the training set, 0.831 in the validation set), excellent calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P > 0.280), and significant clinical utility. Children with WD exhibit a high incidence of dyslipidemia. The nomogram prediction model based on these six variables effectively predicts dyslipidemic risk in pediatric WD patients, enabling early identification and clinical risk stratification.

Mitochondria are bacteria-like organelles with their own DNA (mtDNA) that exist in the cellular cytoplasm of almost every cell in the human body. Because mitochondria are critical for sustaining life, it follows that inherited mtDNA could be a key aetiologic element underlying longevity. Unfortunately, biometric approaches able to quantify heritable contributions of mtDNA have not been available. We directly leveraged the unique matrilineal inheritance pattern of mtDNA to estimate its effects on longevity (defined as the top 10% oldest survivors within their birth cohort). We employed the Utah Population Database (UPDB) to identify 176,348,110 unique kinship links amongst 1,018,929 individuals born between 1700 and 1925 with information on matrilineal versus patrilineal relatedness. Across 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th degree kin, matrilineal relatives were more similar in their longevity outcomes than were non-maternal relatives. Variance component analyses indicated nuclear DNA heritability of 23-26% and mtDNA heritability of at least 5% - despite mtDNA constituting only ∼16.6 k base pairs (versus 2,875,002 k base pairs for nuclear DNA). Moreover, sharing the maternal line of a longevous relative translated to an average of 11.3 months extra years of life. Results collectively suggest that mtDNA may be an important element of unusually long lifespans. This project was supported by RF1-AG073189 and R01-AG022095 from the National Institute on Aging (NIA).

Gastrointestinal cancers account for 39.0% of global cancer-related deaths. The rising incidence of early-onset gastrointestinal cancers poses a substantial public health challenge due to their aggressive nature and poor prognosis. Using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database, we analyzed temporal trends (1990-2021) in age-standardized incidence (ASIR), mortality (ASMR), and disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) rates for early-onset gastrointestinal cancers among individuals aged 15-49 years. Analyses included burden by age, sex, region, and socio-demographic index (SDI). Joinpoint regression estimated average annual percentage changes (AAPC), and future trends (2022-2036) were projected using the Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort model. In 2021, there were 499,800 new cases of early-onset gastrointestinal cancers globally. Colorectal and stomach cancers were most prevalent. From 1990-2021, ASIR increased only for colorectal cancer (AAPC: 0.37, 95%CI: 0.24-0.50), while declines occurred in esophageal, stomach, liver, pancreatic, and gallbladder/biliary tract cancers. Males bore a higher burden except for gallbladder/biliary tract cancer. Significant disparities existed across regions, genders, and SDI levels. Smoking and high body-mass index were leading risk factors. Projections indicate rising ASIRs for early-onset colorectal and esophageal cancers, stable liver cancer incidence, and diminishing incidence, mortality, and DALYs rates for stomach, pancreatic, and gallbladder and biliary tract cancers. Early-onset gastrointestinal cancers represent a substantial and evolving global burden, with notable variations by cancer type, age, sex, region, and SDI. Targeted prevention and healthcare strategies are urgently needed to address modifiable risk factors and reduce disparities.
40888532	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Refracting Blame in the Fentanyl Era: The Narrative Battleground on Facebook and Instagram.	Background: More than 80,000 Americans died of drug overdoses between August 2022 and August 2023, a crisis most recently driven by synthetic opioids like fentanyl.Objectives: To investigate how blame for the opioid crisis is constructed within the most engaging content on Facebook and Instagram by identifying the dominant thematic frames and patterns of blame attribution. Using CrowdTangle, we collected US opioid-related posts from July 2022 to June 2023 and analyzed the top 0.5% most-engaged posts (1,267 total). Three trained coders used a detailed codebook to categorize content, focusing on thematic frames, blame attribution, and source partisanship. Results: Results revealed a discourse dominated by a criminal justice perspective (45.5% of posts), with blame most frequently attributed to illicit suppliers (52.2%) while institutional actors like pharmaceutical companies were largely ignored (<1%). Partisan sources were highly prevalent, and there were significant differences in how blame was assigned between right-leaning and left-leaning accounts. Notably, references to harm reduction and evidence-based treatments were minimal.Conclusions: The most engaging social media content on the opioid crisis does not reflect broad public sentiment but rather the amplified narratives of specific interest groups, particularly law enforcement and political actors. These findings demonstrate how popular online discourse can foreground criminality and partisan conflict over public health solutions, with critical implications for health communication.
40913995	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	The influence of autoinjector applied force and shield size on abdominal skin and subcutaneous tissue deformation - An in-vivo ultrasound and digital image correlation study.	Shield-triggered autoinjectors (AIs) aim to reduce needle phobia and accidental needlestick injuries and improve usability. However, they may cause deeper injections due to tissue compression. This study investigates the mechanical response of AI application into abdominal tissue in-vivo. Tissue thickness/compression level, skin strain, and indentation depth were measured in 10 healthy participants. Digital image correlation (DIC) captured the skin surface, while an ultrasound (US) probe attached to a 3D-printed shield recorded the underlying skin and subcutaneous tissue (SCT) during application of forces up to 20 N using two indenter sizes (Ø15 mm and Ø30 mm). Increased force correlated with reduced skin + SCT layer thickness; however, a non-linear tissue lockup/plateau around 8-10 N was evident. The Ø30 indenter caused a 45 % mean compression, while the Ø15 resulted in 55 %. ANOVA revealed statistical differences between shield sizes for indentation depth and skin + SCT thickness reduction (p < 0.05). ANOVA further revealed a statistical difference between mean indentation depth for Ø15 (50.39 mm) versus Ø30 (34.84 mm) (p < 0.05). Average strain rates were higher (10.5 % versus 15 %) and skin surface deflection curves were steeper for Ø15 compared to Ø30. Skin + SCT compression increases until it reaches a lock-up state, but indentation depth responds linearly to increases in force. The high level of tissue compression will increase the risk of intramuscular injections when using shield-triggered AIs, depending on needle length, activation force, and shield size. Therefore, increasing shield sizes to reduce tissue compression and indentation depth can enhance user experience and the probability of reaching the subcutaneous layer. Conclusions are drawn from a small, homogenous cohort, and although the trends are clear, variation between participants highlight the complex nature of human skin tissue. More user groups and injection sites should be investigated.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of three brief interventions (spoken/guided meditation, nature sounds, or music) on patients' subjective experience with intravitreal injections (IVIs). A total of 121 consecutive patients were randomized into four cohorts: spoken/guided meditation (n = 31), nature sounds (n = 30), music (classical or jazz, n = 30), and control (n = 30). Subjective anxiety levels were recorded prior to and following a three- to five-minute intervention in the first three study groups as well as following the IVI. Controls did not participate in an intervention prior to the injection. Subjective pain with the injection was recorded, as was patient satisfaction with the injection experience. All three intervention cohorts experienced, on average, a 33% reduction in anxiety level after the intervention and prior to their IVI. While there was a trend toward lower post-intervention anxiety among those in the music cohort compared to controls, this difference did not reach statistical significance, nor was there a significant difference in pain or satisfaction across all groups, including controls. The number of prior intravitreal injections was mildly inversely correlated with pain in all subjects. In this study, brief pre-injection music and meditation interventions demonstrated intra-cohort anxiolytic effects, though they did not prove statistically effective at reducing anxiety or influencing perceptions of pain or patient satisfaction compared to control. We encourage further investigation into non-invasive methods for reducing pain and anxiety, as well as enhancing the patient experience during ophthalmologic procedures.

Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality globally and is worsened in crisis-affected countries like Lebanon. This study explored how social determinants of health relate to preterm birth and maternal postpartum outcomes, including quality of life (QoL), perceived stress, and social support. to explore the impact of the social environment in polycrises context on preterm birth, the association between preterm birth and maternal postpartum QoL, perceived stress, and social support. A prospective cohort study was conducted in three Lebanese hospitals from September 2021 to December 2023. A total of 116 mother-infant pairs (78 full-term, 38 preterm) were recruited. Data on social determinants, perceived stress (PSS-10), social support (MSPSS), and QoL (WHOQOL-BREF) were collected at delivery and 4 to 6 months postpartum. Analyses included t tests, chi-square tests, and linear mixed models. Mothers of preterm infants had significantly higher stress (PSS-10: 19.53 vs 15.29, P=.011) and lower QoL scores across physical (39.16 vs 57.4, P<.001), psychological (54.08 vs 66.91, P<.001), and social (58.53 vs 69.56, P=.007) domains at delivery. At 4 to 6 months postpartum, all mothers reported declines in social support (71.8 vs 67.3, P=.003), social QoL (69.4 vs 61.4, P=.005), and environmental QoL (70 vs 64.5, P=.012). This study highlights the impact of social support, stress, and QoL on preterm birth outcomes in a crisis-affected region. Mothers of preterm infants experienced higher stress and lower QoL at birth, suggesting the need for targeted interventions to support maternal mental health. Addressing these social determinants is needed for improving pregnancy outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations facing multiple social and economic challenges.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) offer significant cardiorenal benefits for people with type 2 diabetes (PwT2D). However, concerns remain regarding their association with diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA). (1) To compare demographics, precipitating factors, biochemical features, management, and outcomes of acute DKA admissions between SGLT2i users (n = 267) and non-users (n = 793) with T2D. (2) To conduct a systematic review and meta-summary of published studies describing SGLT2i-associated DKA in T2D. A retrospective cohort study analysed data from 18 UK hospitals (April 2018-March 2024), using standardised DKA protocols. Propensity score matching compared DKA episodes between SGLT2i users and non-users. In addition, a systematic review and meta-summary was performed including studies from PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science focusing on DKA in PwT2D treated with SGLT2i. Within the DEKODE cohort, 534 matched individuals were analysed. SGLT2i users had lower glucose, pH, and bicarbonate levels than non-users. SGLT2i was identified as the sole precipitant in 30.3% of cases. Despite lower admission glucose and more profound acidosis, both SGLT2i users and non-users had similar clinical outcomes including duration of DKA and length of hospital stay. In the meta-summary of 1024 cases of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA from 247 studies, the median age was 54.6 years, with 49.7% male and a median diabetes duration of 10 years. Biochemical features included acidosis (median pH 7.1), elevated ketones (5.7 mmol/L), and modest hyperglycaemia (10.6 mmol/L). DKA typically developed after 2 months of SGLT2i use, with 21.1% requiring intensive care admission. Despite lower admission glucose, more pronounced acidosis, and a higher incidence of hypokalaemia episodes, clinical outcomes were similar between the matched population of SGLT2i users and non-users. This may be attributed to earlier identification of euglycaemic DKA, timely intervention, as well as the distinct pathophysiological profile of SGLT2i-associated DKA. Improved education on risk factors and preventive strategies is warranted with SGLT2i therapy.

Orbital cavernous hemangiomas (OCH) are rare benign vascular tumors that pose therapeutic challenges due to their proximity to critical visual structures. While surgical resection remains the standard of care, Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative. However, the optimal fractionation strategy, single-session versus hypofractionated treatment, remains unclear. This review aims to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of single-session versus hypofractionated GKRS for OCH through a systematic review, meta-analysis, and a complementary institutional case series. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (registration code:1061256). Databases were searched from inception through April 2025. Eligible studies reported outcomes of GKRS for OCH using either single-session or hypofractionated treatment. Meta-analyses were performed to compare (1) the proportion of patients with tumor volume reduction, (2) the mean percentage reduction in tumor volume, and (3) the proportion of patients with improvement in visual symptoms. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklists. Funnel plots and Egger's test were used to assess publication bias. Additionally, three institutional cases treated with GKRS were included to supplement the clinical context. Eleven studies comprising 117 patients were included, with an additional 3 patients from our institution. Tumor volume reduction was observed in 100 % of patients in the fractionated group and 89 % in the single-session group (p = 0.0853). The pooled mean percentage volume reduction was -2.65 % (95 % CI: -6.36 to 3.97) in the fractionated group and -2.85 % (95 % CI: -8.97 to 4.43) in the single-session group (p = 0.9572). Improvement in visual symptoms was seen in 80 % of patients in the fractionated group and 69 % in the single-session group (p = 0.4763). Funnel plots demonstrated minimal publication bias, except for a potential small-study effect in visual symptom outcomes. JBI assessment indicated moderate to high methodological quality across most studies. Both single-session and hypofractionated GKRS appear to be effective and safe treatment options for OCH, with comparable clinical outcomes. Hypofractionation may offer advantages in select patients with optic nerve proximity, though current evidence does not show statistically significant differences between approaches. Single-session GKRS remains a pragmatic and effective option in anatomically favorable cases and may be complemented by adaptive or rescue fractionation strategies when tumor response is suboptimal or recurrence is observed. Prospective multicenter studies with standardized outcome reporting are needed to define optimal treatment strategies.
40909127	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Performance and clinical implications of non-invasive prenatal testing for rare chromosomal abnormalities: a retrospective study of 94,125 cases.	Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has demonstrated robust performance in detecting common trisomies and copy number variations. However, its clinical utility for rare chromosomal abnormalities (RCAs) remains controversial due to low positive predictive value (PPV). This study retrospectively analyzed the data of 94,125 cases that underwent NIPT at Ganzhou Maternal and Child Health Hospital in China. This dataset was used to evaluate NIPT performance in RCAs detection and track pregnancy outcomes of positive cases. In the cohort of 94,125 pregnancies undergoing NIPT, 336 cases (0.36%) were found to carry RCAs. Among them, 102 cases underwent validation through karyotyping and/or chromosome microarray analysis. Of the 102 validated cases, seven were true positives (PPV = 6.86%). Additionally, 3 cases exhibited uniparental disomy consistent with the NIPT-reported chromosomal anomalies. Of 268 singleton neonates, 68 (25.37%) were small-for-gestational-age. This study found that most NIPT-detected RCAs were associated with maternal age, while Trisomy seven occurred independently of maternal age. Concurrent use of karyotyping and chromosome microarray analysis, rather than karyotyping alone, mitigates culture-related bias and enhances the PPV. Both biological and methodological factors contribute to the low PPV of NIPT for RCAs. Despite a low PPV, pregnancies with NIPT-indicated RCAs showed elevated risks of fetal loss, small-for-gestational-age, and uniparental disomy, though not preterm birth. Thus, NIPT-detected RCAs retain clinical significance for risk stratification and pregnancy management.

Fractures are a common occurrence in childhood, with approximately one-third of boys and girls sustaining at least one fracture before the age of 17. Both-bone forearm fractures, particularly those involving the radius and ulna, are more common in the non-dominant hand and in boys and usually involve the distal portions of both bones. If not properly treated, these injuries can have a significant impact on limb function. This study aimed to determine the functional outcomes of radius and ulnar shaft fractures in children treated with intramedullary Kirschner's wire fixation, assessed using standardized, objective clinical criteria at eight weeks postoperatively, and to analyze associated demographic and fracture-related factors and postoperative complications. This descriptive study was conducted in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Bacha Khan Medical College/Mardan Medical Complex, Mardan, over a seven-month period from March 8, 2024, to October 8, 2024. During this time, a total of 348 pediatric patients aged four to 14 years presented with diaphyseal forearm fractures, of whom 209 were successfully managed non-operatively with closed reduction and casting. The remaining 139 children (both genders), whose fractures were deemed unstable after attempted closed reduction - defined radiographically as angulation >10°, displacement >50%, or rotational malalignment - were included in this study. Both open and closed fractures meeting these criteria were eligible. Functional outcomes following intramedullary Kirschner wire fixation were systematically assessed at an eight-week postoperative follow-up. Outcomes were categorized as excellent, good, fair, or poor based on objective clinical assessment, which included measurement of elbow and forearm range of motion, evaluation of pain, presence of residual deformity, and ability to return to age-appropriate daily activities, using standardized institutional criteria. The mean age of the participants was 8.75 ± 2.97 years. Regarding functional outcomes, 99 children (71.2%) achieved an excellent result, 20 (14.4%) had a good outcome, 13 (9.4%) had a fair outcome, and seven (5%) had a poor outcome. Functional outcomes were slightly better in younger children (aged four to nine years) and in males, although the differences were not statistically significant. No major postoperative complications, defined as those requiring reoperation or resulting in permanent functional impairment, were observed during the eight-week follow-up. Minor complications such as transient pin tract infections and minor wire migration were noted but resolved without additional surgery. Intramedullary Kirschner wire fixation proved to be an effective treatment for unstable radius and ulnar shaft fractures in children, resulting in predominantly favorable functional outcomes. The majority of patients demonstrated excellent recovery with minimal complications, supporting the procedure's reliability and safety in the pediatric population. Outcomes were consistent across age groups and genders, with slightly better results observed in younger children and those with early intervention. Future multicenter studies with larger sample sizes and longer-term follow-up are recommended to validate these findings and further refine treatment protocols for pediatric forearm fractures.

Acute pyelonephritis is a common renal infection that can become life-threatening when complicated by structural abnormalities, resistant pathogens, or systemic comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. While common complications include renal abscess and sepsis, spontaneous subcapsular hematoma is a rare but serious manifestation that requires prompt recognition and intervention. This article reports the case of a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who presented with fever, flank pain, vomiting, and gross hematuria. She was diagnosed with complicated pyelonephritis and sepsis. Laboratory workup revealed leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Coagulation studies were within normal limits, and the patient was not on any anticoagulant therapy. Initial abdominal CT showed left renal parenchymal inflammation without fluid collection. Follow-up imaging revealed a subcapsular hematoma compressing the left kidney, with associated extension into the left psoas muscle. The patient received broad-spectrum antibiotics, ICU-level care, and multiple transfusions. Over the course of hospitalization and follow-up, she required percutaneous drainage and was eventually scheduled for nephrectomy due to significantly reduced left renal function. This case documents the radiologic changes of subcapsular, perinephric, and psoas hematomas over 2- and 6-month intervals, allowing detailed evaluation of their progression through serial imaging follow-up.

Rational optimization of the pore size and topology of porous nanocarriers is crucial for improving the loading amount of luminophore and enhancing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) performance. In this study, an equimolar linear ligand replacement strategy was employed to synthesize novel mesoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for encapsulating Ru(bpy)32+ (Ru@Zr MOFs) under room temperature without an acid modulator. Ingenious ligand substitution allows precise control of pore size, enabling encapsulation at the single-molecule level within mesoporous cages. The external small windows, which are slightly smaller than the internal cavity, effectively inhibit the leakage of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition, to further enhance the charge transfer efficiency, the anode co-reactant polyethyleneimine (PEI) was covalently bound to Ru@Zr MOFs, achieving self-enhanced ECL. Based on this innovative structure, we developed a dual-signal ECL sensor for ultrasensitive detection of miRNA-21. TiO2-Au NPs were introduced as a co-reaction accelerator to amplify the cathodic ECL signal. The ratio of the two signals renders the ECL sensor exceptional sensitivity, with a detection limit as low as 1.8 × 10-18 M. This work highlights the significant advantages of equimolar linear ligand replacement strategy in the mesoporous regulation of MOFs, which is conducive to advancing the development of MOFs-based ECL sensors in biomolecule detection and medical diagnostics.

Abiraterone acetate (AA) is approved for prostate cancer at a standard dose of 1,000 mg fasting. Because of a significant food effect, a lower dose (250 mg with food-AA low dose [AALD]) shows similar efficacy at 75% lower cost. In Brazil, 80% of patients rely on the public health care system, which does not cover the standard dose. Hospital de Base has been using AALD since March 2021. We retrospectively reviewed patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who received AALD at any treatment line, regardless of previous chemotherapy, between March 2021 and May 2023. The primary end point was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (RR; defined as a decrease of ≥50% in PSA level after 12 weeks of treatment). Secondary end points included time to treatment failure (TTF), overall survival (OS), and PSA RR ≥50% at nadir. Ninety-six patients were included. Sixty-three patients (65.6%) received AALD in mCRPC first-line. After a median follow-up of 24.4 months, 53 patients (60.2%) achieved the primary end point, and 65 (69.9%) achieved a PSA reduction of ≥50% at nadir. Patients treated with AALD pre-docetaxel in the mCRPC had a higher PSA response at 12 weeks (68.3% v 40%, P = .015) and at nadir (76.1% v 53.8%, P = .036). First-line AALD was associated with better PSA responses. The median TTF was 7.9 months and the median OS was 20.6 months. Achieving a ≥50% PSA response at 12 weeks was associated with improved TTF (13.6 v 4.6 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37, P < .001) and OS (28.9 v 12.2 months, HR = 0.44, P = .004). AALD showed meaningful efficacy and survival outcomes. We support AALD use, especially where standard dosing is unaffordable.

In this review, we examine the challenges facing researchers studying cognitive function in adult patients with ACI. We consider the effect of dysregulated cortisol on cognition in patients with ACI, and the inability of current guideline-recommended glucocorticoid treatment regimens to accurately reproduce circadian and ultradian cortisol secretion rhythms. Factors that contribute to inter- and intraindividual response are presented; the indirect effects of ACI comorbidities, complications, and symptoms on cognitive dysfunction are reviewed; and obstacles to employing neurocognitive testing are identified. Finally, we outline potential approaches to studying cognition in ACI using well-designed studies that account for the complexities and gaps in ACI research.

To examine the relationship between feeding therapy and the timing of independent oral feeding (IOF) in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A retrospective analysis of 536 preterm infants (<37 wk gestation) admitted to a level IV NICU between January 2017 and December 2019 was conducted. Clinical and therapy data were extracted from the electronic health record to examine associations between feeding therapy utilization and feeding outcomes. Medically complex infants were more likely to receive a feeding therapy referral (p = .001), and infants who received feeding therapy achieved IOF an average of 1.5 wk later than those who did not (p < .001). Among infants receiving therapy, earlier initiation was beneficial as each additional week of delay in therapy initiation corresponded to a 0.02-week delay in achieving IOF after adjusting for medical factors (p = .023). No association was found between feeding therapy frequency and postmenstrual age at IOF. Early initiation of feeding therapy may help expedite IOF. Timely referrals can support oral motor development and improve feeding outcomes in preterm infants. The lack of association with frequency may reflect staffing limitations that impacted consistent therapy delivery rather than a true absence of benefit.

This study examines the impact of Colombia's mental health system reforms (1999-2021) on suicide mortality trends using national vital statistics data (51,924 suicide-related deaths). Through joinpoint regression and interrupted time series analyses, we assessed age-standardized suicide rates (ASSRs) across demographic subgroups. Results revealed no statistically significant associations between policy reforms and suicide trends, despite Colombia's progressive legislative advancements, including Law 1616 (2013) and expanded mental health services. Key findings include (1) declining ASSR for adolescents (-0.75% annually, p < 0.001) but rising rates among women (+3.8% post-2012, p < 0.05); (2) rural areas consistently exhibited higher ASSRs than urban settings; and (3) reforms showed nonsignificant immediate or sustained effects (p > 0.05). The study underscores the complexity of suicide determinants, suggesting that structural factors (e.g., socioeconomic disparities) may outweigh health-sector interventions. These findings highlight the need for integrated, context-specific suicide prevention strategies in Colombia and similar settings.

Low-level viremia (LLV) is associated with the progression of liver fibrosis and a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The present study aimed to compare the efficacy between nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) therapy and combination therapy of NAs and pegylated interferon-α (pegIFN-α) in entecavir (ETV)-treated CHB patients with LLV. This was a retrospective cohort study. ETV-treated CHB patients with LLV were included and divided into the NA group and the NA+IFN group. The NA group comprised patients switching to tenofovir alafenamide fumarate, whereas the NA+IFN group comprised those adding on pegIFN-α additionally. We compared changes in HBV markers and complete virological response (CVR) between the two groups. A total of 127 patients were enrolled, including 51 in NA+IFN group and 76 in NA group. In the NA+IFN group, the decline in HBsAg level from baseline (△ HBsAg) was significantly greater (-0.17 log10IU/mL vs. -0.06 log10IU/mL, P = 0.011) at week 24, and HBsAg clearance rate and △ HBsAg were significantly higher (8.9% vs. 0%, P = 0.017; -0.27 log10IU/mL vs. -0.11 log10IU/mL, P = 0.023) at week 48. The 48-week CVR rate in the NA+IFN group was 66.7% (34/51), which was comparable to 68.4% (52/76) in the NA group (P = 0.836). In ETV-treated patients with LLV, receiving NAs plus pegIFN-α tends to increase the effect of HBsAg clearance.

"This study examines how dietary nutrient patterns vary among individuals with different chronotypes. In other words, this research explores the potential connections between nutrient intake and circadian rhythm. In this secondary data analysis, we used data from 3,072 adult participants (mean age: 30.16 y (SD = 10.92); 49.8% males) who completed a survey between September 2022 and July 2023. Chronotypes were assessed using the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), and dietary intake was measured through 24-h dietary recall. One-way ANOVA and Multinomial regression analysis were used to investigate the associations. The intermediate chronotype was the most common among participants (73% vs 13% early and 14% late chronotype). Unlike morning types, intermediate and evening chronotypes had similar demographic and dietary characteristics. Four nutrient patterns were identified: ""Vit B-rich,"" ""Plant-based,"" ""Antioxidant,"" and ""High-fat."" ""Vit B-rich pattern"" was linked to a morning chronotype. Greater adherence to the ""antioxidant pattern,"" characterized by nutrients such as vit A, vit C, and folate, was associated with a lower likelihood of being an evening type. Adherers of ""high-fat pattern"" were less likely to be intermediate types. ""Plant-based"" pattern characterized by fibre, magnesium, etc. was not associated with any chronotype. Morning chronotypes may gravitate toward or consume more foods rich in vit B.

The development of an impulsive automated insulin delivery system (i-AiDS) for type 1 diabetes mellitus aims to provide real-time blood glucose regulation with minimal human intervention. This study presents the validation of an offset-free impulsive zone model predictive control strategy designed to cope with external disturbances such as meal intake and plant-model mismatch in a diabetic rat model. Fourteen male Wistar rats induced diabetes with streptozotocin were monitored using an continuous glucose monitoring and regulated by delivering insulin with a customized low-cost pump. After acquiring diabetes condition, the procedure for installing the devices in the rat is carried out. During the first day, manual insulin injections are made by the pump, the glucose response is recorded by the interface and an off-line parametric estimation is executed. Based on the parameters found, simulations are used for the first tuning of the controller and the estimator. During the second day, the parameters of the model and the control are tested and adjusted. Finally, on the third day, a 72-hour test of the impulsive begins in full autonomous mode. Results showed that the controller achieved an average of 83.4% of the time within the target range of 80-180 mg/dL, with no severe hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events. The median absolute relative difference between model predictions and actual sensor data was 24.66%, indicating the presence of plant-model mismatch that was effectively handled by the controller. Peak hyperglycemic events reached 320 mg/dL, but were regulated within 50 minutes, while mild hypoglycemic events occurred in 3.62 ± 1.8 cases per subject. The study demonstrates the efficacy of the controller in managing unannounced carbohydrate intake and physiological disturbances in a real-world preclinical environment. These findings provide a foundation for future clinical trials, emphasizing the importance of in vivo validation of control strategies to refine the i-AiDS for human use. Improvements in model accuracy and dynamic parameter tuning could further enhance performance, particularly in longer experimental periods.

PurposeTo summarize the currently available evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation performed by intensivists.MethodsWe conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies of any design in which patients underwent ECMO cannulation by intensivists. The search was updated on Dec 15, 2024. Two independent authors screened titles and abstracts for general applicability, followed by full-text review to determine whether studies met the following criteria: (1) adult patients and (2) ECMO cannulation performed by intensivists. Two independent authors extracted study characteristics and outcomes of interest. The Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation was used to stabilize variance. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled complication rates.ResultsA total of 209 studies were screened, and 12 retrospective, single-center studies were included. The pooled complication rate of ECMO cannulations performed by intensivists was 2% per cannula and 5% per patient. In the subgroup of VA ECMO cannulations, the complication rate was 9% per patient, whereas for VV ECMO cannulations, it was 4% per patient.ConclusionsECMO cannulation by intensivists appears to be safe and feasible when supported by adequate training, credentialing processes, and backup support from surgeons in the event of complications such as vascular injury.

Objective: CamAPS FX is a customizable hybrid closed-loop app with a default target glucose of 105 mg/dL. The personal glucose target is user-adjustable in 1 mg/dL increments between 80 and 198 mg/dL in 30-min segments over 24 h. We assessed the impact of different personal glucose targets on glycemic control during real-world use of CamAPS FX in different age-groups. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from real-world CamAPS FX users from 11 countries across all age-groups (1 to 90 years), who used the system between December 1, 2022 and November 30, 2023, and had a minimum of 8 weeks of closed-loop use. Every sensor glucose reading was matched to the user-specified glucose target. Results: In total, 8604 users (mean age 32 ± 19 years, median days of data 89 [IQR 59, 119]) were included. Personal glucose targets were most frequently used by very young children (>50%), followed by school-aged children (>40%). All other age-groups used the default target 65%-68% of the time. Overall, personal glucose targets >120 mg/dL were associated with time in target range <70%. Time <70 mg/dL remained <4% across targets, apart from at the lowest (80-89 mg/dL). Older adults achieved time in range ≥70% across all targets. Very young children and young adults were only able to achieve time in range >70% with targets set below the default, which was associated with time <70 mg/dL of >4% in very young children. Conclusions: Personal glucose targets are frequently used, with clinical impact differing depending on user-age. Adjusting glucose targets may help to achieve recommended glycemic targets and individual glycemic goals.

First rib fractures in children are typically associated with high-impact trauma; atraumatic etiologies remain understudied. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the presentation and management of pediatric first rib fractures in the absence of major trauma. This is a retrospective study of pediatric patients diagnosed with first rib fractures between 2000-2023 at a quaternary, free-standing children's hospital. Exclusion criteria were major trauma and baseline bone disease. We identified 24 patients with first rib fracture in the absence of major trauma (median age 14 years, 15 (63%) male). The most common etiologies were exercise (n=8, 33%), stretching (n=5, 21%), and idiopathic (n=5, 21%). The most common symptom was ipsilateral shoulder pain (n=16, 67%). Chest x-ray (CXR) was the primary diagnosis modality (n=16, 67%). Seven patients (29%) had chest computed tomography (CT), which showed no additional pathology. Most first rib fractures were non-displaced (n=19, 79%), and the rest were minimally displaced (n=5, 21%). Most patients did not have any associated injuries (n=20, 83%), 3 patients (13%) had additional rib fractures, and one patient (4%) had concurrent pneumonia. All patients were managed non-operatively; 12 patients (50%) were seen for follow-up with repeat radiological imaging, primarily CXR. Most patients had appropriate healing on initial follow-up; one patient had delayed healing on initial CXR, requiring follow-up CT. Pediatric first rib fractures can occur in the absence of major trauma; extensive additional workup is often not necessary. Diagnostic chest computed tomography did not yield clinically significant findings beyond x-ray.
40911767	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article;Multicenter Study;Observational Study	Hemodynamic Effects of Guideline-Based Sedation in Mechanically Ventilated Adults: A Multicenter Observational Analysis.	Propofol is a first-line sedative for adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). However, it can contribute to hemodynamic instability, especially during intubation. The magnitude, timing, risk factors, and variability of sedation-associated mean arterial pressure (MAP) changes remain poorly characterized in ICU settings. To quantify MAP changes following propofol sedation, identify risk factors for hemodynamic instability, and characterize associated interventions. Retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome was MAP change within 2 hours following sedation. Secondary outcomes included vasopressor use and hypotension (MAP ≤ 60 mm Hg). Mixed-effects modeling was used to account for individual patient differences. Adults (≥ 18 yrs old) who required IMV and received greater than or equal to 6 consecutive hours of propofol infusion, between May 5th, 2018, and July 31st, 2024, in 11 ICUs across the Mayo Clinic, spanning 5 hospitals in 4 states. The primary outcome was the change in MAP within 2 hours following the initiation of propofol-based sedation. Across 16,418 patients, 25.2% were on vasopressors before sedation initiation. Among the remaining 12,281 patients, 40.3% required vasopressors and 7.7% experienced hypotension within 2 hours of sedation. Propofol-based sedation was associated with a MAP reduction within the first 30 minutes (-6.58 mm Hg; 95% CI, -6.85 to -6.32; p < 0.001). There was substantial interpatient variability in both baseline MAP, and MAP decline after sedation (9.5 and 40.9% between-patient differences, respectively). Higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (-0.31 mm Hg/point), older age (-0.04 mm Hg/yr), and male sex (-0.47 mm Hg) were associated with lower MAP. Patients with higher illness severity experienced progressively greater MAP decline over time (-0.20 mm Hg/hr/SOFA point; p < 0.001). Propofol-based sedation was associated with clinically significant hemodynamic effects requiring intervention in the early post-intubation period. The marked interpatient variability in hemodynamic responses highlights the importance of personalized management approaches, including risk stratification based on age, sex, and illness severity.

Background: Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) remains a critical medical-surgical emergency associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden worldwide. Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, NVUGIB continues to pose complex clinical challenges, particularly in resource-limited settings. Methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed 364 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with NVUGIB and hospitalized at the First Surgical Clinic of the County Emergency Clinical Hospital Craiova between January 2009 and December 2014. Inclusion criteria required a confirmed diagnosis based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE). Demographic variables, etiology, comorbidities, drug-induced triggers, laboratory parameters, onset-to-admission and onset-to-surgery intervals, endoscopic findings, therapeutic interventions (medical, endoscopic, surgical), rebleeding rates, and mortality were recorded and analyzed. Results were descriptively compared with historical data from the national and international literature. Due to the retrospective and aggregate nature of the data, survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) was not applicable. Results: Peptic ulcers, erosive gastritis, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and gastric neoplasms were the predominant etiologies. NSAID use, oral anticoagulation, and alcohol consumption emerged as major risk factors. Endoscopic hemostasis was achieved in the majority of cases; surgical intervention was required in 11.5% of patients, mainly for refractory or recurrent bleeding. The overall mortality rate was 10.9%, consistent with historical benchmarks. Comparative analysis revealed trends in etiology and management reflecting evolving clinical practice standards. Conclusions: NVUGIB remains a significant clinical challenge with persistent mortality and rebleeding risks. This cohort highlights the need for timely diagnosis, risk stratification, and an evidence-based therapeutic strategy integrating modern endoscopic and surgical options. An updated diagnostic and management algorithm is proposed to guide practical decision-making and optimize outcomes in similar tertiary care settings.
40882352	auto_exclude	language		exclude	language	2025	Journal Article	Functional and clinical insights into nuclear receptor variants for advancing precision diagnostics in male infertility.	Nuclear receptors, including steroidogenic factor 1 (NR5A1/SF1) and the androgen receptor (AR), are transcription factors regulating physiological processes, e.g., reproduction. Pathogenic variants in these receptors are associated with a broad spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from differences in sexual development to isolated male infertility. However, standardised methods to classify variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in these genes are lacking, complicating diagnosis and individualised treatment. We queried rare NR5A1 and AR variants in exome/genome sequencing data of 2127 infertile men. Pathogenicity assessment included thorough clinical phenotyping, familial segregation, in silico pathogenicity prediction combining traditional and machine-learning tools, and functional evaluation of the variants using in vitro assays. We identified a total of seven heterozygous NR5A1 variants in 10 infertile men and 22 hemizygous AR variants in 31 infertile men with severe oligo-/azoospermia. Of these, three SF1 and seven AR variants displayed significantly reduced transcriptional activity. This study led to the reclassification of one NR5A1 variant and ten AR variants, including three AR variants that were reclassified from VUS to (likely) pathogenic. Combined phenotype, in silico, and in vitro data led to 60% of all variants (17 out of 29) being classified as (likely) pathogenic per ACMG guidelines, providing insights into the phenotypic features and spermatogenic impairment in affected men. This study highlights the importance of combining clinical and experimental data for the assessment of VUS in nuclear receptors to reliably classify pathogenicity and to improve patient diagnosis and care. This study was carried out within the frame of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)-sponsored Clinical Research Unit 'Male Germ Cells' (CRU326, project 329621271, to F.T., C.F., S.L., and J.G.) and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)-sponsored Junior Scientist Research Centre 'ReproTrack.MS' (grant 01GR2303, to F.T. and S.K.), and was supported by the Medical Faculty Münster via an Innovative Medical Research (IMF) grant (GA-122104, to A.S.G.) and the Clinician Scientist programme CareerS (to S.A.K.).

Associations between childhood maltreatment and adult cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk are well-documented. However, previous research has relied on self-rated health and non-representative cross-sectional data, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings. Moreover, less is known about factors that may buffer the biological embedding of early adversity into health outcomes in adulthood. This study examines whether childhood maltreatment predicts CVD risk in adulthood using objective biomarkers and whether social support buffers this relationship in line with the stress-buffering hypothesis. We analyzed data from 4137 participants in Waves 1, 3, and 5 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Childhood maltreatment and social support were measured using validated scales, and 30-year CVD risk was estimated using the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score. Fractional outcome models were used to examine the main and moderating effects, and sensitivity analyses using Heckman selection models were conducted to address potential selection bias. Childhood maltreatment was significantly related to elevated adult CVD risk, supporting the biological embedding model. In line with the stress-buffering hypothesis, social support moderated this association, buffering the adverse health effects of early maltreatment. Findings support the stress-buffering hypothesis and highlight the importance of early social support in mitigating the long-term physiological impact of childhood adversity. Integrating the biological embedding model with the stress-buffering hypothesis can improve understanding of resilience and inform strategies to reduce health disparities rooted in early life experiences.

The arginine-phenylalanine-amide neuropeptide receptor family comprises a subclass within the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily with crucial roles in physiological regulation. These receptors recognize and bind neuropeptides with an arginine-phenylalanine-amide motif, thereby participating in a variety of biological processes such as energy metabolism, pain perception, and reproductive functions. In this review, we explore the physiological and pathological processes involving these receptors and delve into the structure-activity relationships of their ligand peptides, clarifying the key structural motifs within these neuropeptides that determine their biological activity, pharmacological potency, and receptor selectivity. Particular emphasis is placed on their roles in modulating nociception, regulating appetite, and maintaining reproductive health. Additionally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of structure-based drug design targeting these receptors based on existing cryo-electron microscopy structures. The available structural insights into ligand-binding pockets and G protein-receptor interaction interfaces provide a clear perspective and valuable complement to ligand optimization.

This study aimed to examine the effect of opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) on postoperative outcome indicators and explore its application in thoracoscopic or laparoscopic as well as non-thoracoscopic or laparoscopic surgeries, providing a scientific basis for clinical decision-making. A systematic search was conducted for clinical studies comparing OFA and opioid-based anesthesia (OBA) published from the establishment of the databases to May 2025 using databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Secondary outcomes included perioperative recovery indicators, the need for postoperative emergency analgesia, postoperative pain score (VAS, NRS), and adverse reactions. A total of 3,766 relevant studies were initially identified, and 68 randomized controlled trials involving 5,426 patients were ultimately included. Compared with OBA, OFA significantly reduced the risks of PONV (RR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.64), nausea alone (RR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.25-0.46), vomiting alone (RR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.25-0.46), and the need for postoperative emergency analgesia (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51-0.72). OFA was also associated with lower 24 h postoperative NRS pain scores (SMD = -0.32, 95% CI: -0.53 to -0.10). For outcomes with high heterogeneity (I 2 > 75%), the systematic review showed that most studies did not find a significant reduction in postoperative VAS pain scores with OFA. However, over two-thirds of the studies have shown that OFA can improve the quality of postoperative recovery (QoR-40). Approximately half of the studies suggested that OFA may prolong extubation time, while most found no significant difference in PACU stay time. In summary, OFA not only significantly reduces postoperative PONV, but also lowers the demand for analgesic drugs and improves the quality of postoperative recovery. However, its effect on some postoperative recovery indicators is limited, and further high-quality studies are required to confirm these findings. OFA is expected to serve as a safe and effective anesthesia strategy to optimize the perioperative outcomes of patients.

A common conflation happens both in everyday discussions in medicine as well as in the medical literature-namely, equating 'parents of minors' with 'surrogate decision makers.' It is important for pediatric clinicians and ethicists to stop using language that confuses and obscures the important difference between surrogates and parents in ways that affect the ethics of decision-making for minors. Specifically, parents of minor children are morally different than surrogates, and by using surrogate language, a misunderstanding arises that distorts the moral space and relevant obligations that pediatric providers, parents of minors, and even pediatric patients find themselves in when making medical decisions.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential regulators of gene expression, yet few comprehensive databases exist for miRNA expression in non-model species, limiting our ability to characterize their roles in gene regulation, development, and disease. Similarly, isomiRs - length and sequence isoforms of canonical miRNAs with potentially altered regulatory targets and functions - have received even less attention in non-model species, including the horse, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of their biological significance. To address these challenges, we developed an open-source, containerized pipeline for identifying and quantifying miRNAs and isomiRs (FARmiR: Framework for Analysis and Refinement of miRNAs), and an associated interactive browser (AIMEE: Animal IsomiR and MiRNA Expression Explorer). AIMEE was developed to make miRNA expression data more accessible and user-friendly, a feature often lacking from other expression atlases. These tools were developed using equine data but can be readily extended to other species. Using these tools, we aggregated 461 small RNA-seq datasets, spanning 61 distinct tissues, integrating data from public repositories, an American Quarter Horse cohort, and the Functional Annotation of ANimal Genome (FAANG) consortium Thoroughbred samples, predicting 5,781 miRNAs and isomiRs. This work represents the largest systematically curated atlas of equine miRNA expression to date, providing a valuable resource that will enhance our understanding of miRNA and isomiR functions in tissue-specific regulation and ultimately improve biomarker discovery, functional genomics, and precision veterinary medicine.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is the gold standard for evaluating thyroid nodules. However, the patient's clinical condition rarely demands an immediate, definitive diagnosis or additional ancillary studies. This study evaluates the utility of thyroid core needle biopsies (CNBs) as an adjunct to FNA, particularly when ancillary studies are not feasible on cytologic material. The electronic pathology database at a large academic institution was searched for cases of thyroid FNA with concurrent CNB (2000-2024). In total, 140 cases were included, and data on patient demographics, nodule characteristics, diagnoses from cytology and CNB, ancillary studies, and surgical pathology diagnosis were recorded. A definitive diagnosis was made on 98 (70%) cases of CNB concurrent with FNA. Core needle biopsies provided a definitive diagnosis in 16 (64%) FNA category I cases of The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology. Fifty-four (38.5%) CNBs were benign, and 43 (30.7%) CNBs were malignant, including 23 (16.4%) primary thyroid carcinomas, 9 (6.4%) lymphomas, 6 (4.2%) secondary carcinomas, and 5 (3.5%) other malignancies. Nine CNB cases were diagnosed as indeterminate, including 5 atypical cases and 4 suspicious for malignancy. Ancillary studies, including immunostains (49), molecular testing (19), PD-L1 (3), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (2), were performed in 73 (52%) CNBs, and histology diagnoses were in agreement in 39 (79.6%) of 49 cases. Eleven (7.8%) CNBs were nondiagnostic. Minor complications (small hematomas) occurred in 3 (2%) cases. Concurrent FNA and CNB can be valuable, potentially reducing the surgery rate. Core needle biopsy is particularly useful for repeatedly nondiagnostic FNA, atypical cells, or when tissue is needed for diagnostic, prognostic, or molecular profiling of malignancies such as anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.

Benefits in patient comfort, efficiency, and sustainability can come from reducing positron emission tomography (PET) scan's acquisition duration. This study assesses the clinical adequacy of restoring fast-acquisition 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET to its standard-of-care image quality through deep-learning-based (DL) methods. Fast and standard whole-body [18F]FDG PET acquisitions of 117 oncological patients were included in the training and testing of three convolutional neural networks. The best-performing network during training was chosen for clinical evaluation on the test set (N = 25). Visual assessment and lesion detectability of the fast acquisitions, of 20 and 30 seconds per axial field of view (s/AFOV), with and without DL-based denoising, and of the local standard of care, of 70 s/AFOV, were performed by three experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Quantification was conducted globally (voxel-wise), in healthy organs and the reported lesions. Optimised Gaussian and non-local means filters served as benchmarks. Visual assessment revealed 20 and 30 s/AFOV with DL-based denoising to have similar image quality to the standard of care. Average lesion-based sensitivity and positive predictive value were 74% and 72%, respectively, for 20 s/AFOV + DL and 72% and 80% for 30 s/AFOV + DL. DL-based denoising displayed the highest voxel-wise agreement with the standard-of-care (p < 0.001). Liver and lungs in the DL-denoised images exhibited a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the standard of care. The median absolute maximum standardised uptake value deviation in the lesions was as low as 0.39 for 20 s/AFOV + DL and 0.30 for 30 s/AFOV + DL. The proposed DL-based method proved to be suitable for the restoration of fast-acquisition whole-body [18F]FDG PET, having resulted in images similar to the standard-of-care acquisitions. DL-based denoising outperformed standard benchmark methods.

Postpartum women often experience abdominal skin laxity and diastasis rectus abdominis. Lipoabdominoplasty, including anterior rectus sheath plication, is commonly performed to address these issues. However, excessive plication may increase intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and postoperative pain, potentially causing complications. The relationship between plication width, IAP, and postoperative pain remains underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate how plication width impacts IAP and postoperative pain in patients undergoing lipoabdominoplasty. Thirty female patients underwent lipoabdominoplasty with plication of anterior rectus sheath in two-layer suture. IAP was continuously monitored using a urodynamic analysis system (Laborie) throughout the procedure. For analysis, IAP was specifically recorded before and after the plication of the anterior rectus sheath. Postoperative pain was assessed on postoperative day 1 (POD1) using the Numeric Rating Scale for Pain. Plication width, original rectus diastasis width, and corrected distance were recorded and analyzed. Mean IAP increased significantly from 5.7 mmHg pre-plication to 9.3 mmHg post-plication (p < 0.05). Infraumbilical corrected distance (D3, 2.1±0.7 cm) showed the strongest correlation with increased IAP (R = 0.61) and postoperative pain (R = 0.5). No significant correlation was found between BMI, rectus diastasis, and pre-plication IAP. No patients exceeded IAP >12 mmHg. Minor complications occurred in 10% (3/30), including two seromas and one wound dehiscence. Anterior rectus sheath plication during lipoabdominoplasty significantly increased IAP, with the infraumbilical corrected distance (D3) demonstrating the strongest influence. In our study cohort, maintaining D3≤3.6 cm (mean: 2.1 cm) consistently kept IAP below the 12 mmHg safety threshold while achieving optimal esthetic outcomes. Continuous intraoperative IAP monitoring provided an objective method for individualized plication tension adjustment.

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are one of the factors that affect a person's physical and mental health throughout his life. Also, people's decision-making style plays a very effective role in people's performance in facing life events. Therefore, this research was conducted to investigate the mediating role of decision-making styles in the relationship between ACEs and suicidal behaviors in depressed addicted adults. In terms of the purpose, the research was fundamental, and the research method was among the descriptive research of the correlation type. The population of this research included depressed, addicted male adults in Rey City during the first three months of 2023. A total of 240 individuals were selected using convenience sampling, based on a correlational design. All the respondents were men, and the majority of people answering the questions were over 45 years old. They were asked to respond to the ACEs questionnaire, the decision-making styles questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the revised suicidal behavior questionnaire. This research uses descriptive statistics methods including frequency, mean and standard deviation, and inferential methods including model structural equations (path analysis). The findings of this research showed that the direct paths of ACEs on immediate decision-making style (β = 0.18, P = 0.039) and suicidal behaviors (β = 0.45, P = 0.001) are positively significant. Also, the direct path of immediate decision-making style on suicidal behaviors (β = 0.29, P = 0.001) was also positively significant. The results of the bootstrap test showed that the indirect path of ACEs on suicidal behaviors due to immediate decision-making style is also positive and significant (β = 0.05, P = 0.015). Based on mental health policies, it is necessary to organize comprehensive suicide prevention, treatment, and support programs for mental health experts, patients, and families at different levels related to decision-making skills and ACEs.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed outcomes for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and has impacted the timing and use of cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN). As ICB responses vary, we evaluated whether radiographic and radiomic biomarkers were associated with clinical and pathological outcomes. This retrospective cohort study included ICB-treated mRCC patients without upfront CN. Clinical and treatment data were collected, and time to next therapy (TTNT) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariable regression analyses were performed to correlate extracted radiomic features with pathologic outcomes from patients who underwent delayed CN. From 2015 to 2022, 60 mRCC patients met inclusion criteria. Among 43 patients with available imaging data, patients with 3-month radiologic response at both primary and metastatic sites had significantly prolonged TTNT and OS compared to those with progressive disease (PD) at both sites (6-month TTNT 95% vs. 0% and 12-month OS 100% vs. 20%). Primary tumor imaging overestimated pathologically confirmed viable tumor by an average of 622 cm3 (95% CI 285-958 cm3). Imaging contrast enhancement and change in enhancement correlated with pathologic viability (Spearman ρ=0.41 and 0.39, respectively). Radiomic features of energy, run length nonuniformity, busyness, and gray-level nonuniformity identified patients with minimal residual disease with area under the curve (AUC) >0.84. Response patterns in primary and metastatic tumor sites are associated with ICB outcomes. Radiomic features extracted from raw imaging provide an improved surrogate for estimating tumor viability. Efforts to optimize and integrate radiomic data for treatment decision-making are needed.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a serious complication of diabetes that can lead to significant morbidity. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP), rich in growth factors and cytokines, has emerged as a promising treatment to enhance ulcer healing. This study aimed to compare the clinical and histological efficacy of injected PRP versus topically applied PRP and traditional wound care in the management of DFUs. Sixty patients with DFUs were randomly assigned to three equal groups (n = 20 each). Group A received locally injected autologous PRP; Group B received topically applied autologous PRP; and Group C received standard wound care. All patients were followed twice weekly for 12 weeks or until complete healing. Skin biopsies were obtained at baseline and after 12 weeks (or upon completion for unhealed ulcers) for histopathological evaluation. By the end of the 12-week follow-up, 87.5 % of patients treated with PRP (35 out of 40 in Groups A and B) achieved complete ulcer healing, compared to a significantly lower healing rate in the traditional care group (Group C). Histological findings supported the clinical outcomes. No significant difference was found between injected and topically applied PRP in terms of clinical effectiveness. Conclusion: PRP treatment, whether injected or topically applied, significantly enhances the healing of DFUs compared to traditional wound care. Both methods of PRP application demonstrated comparable clinical efficacy.

Obesity is an escalating health problem that has been increasingly associated with surgical complications. In general, open surgical techniques worsen these complications, because they are more tissue-destructive and associated with a relatively long recovery period. Minimally invasive techniques, such as endoscopic spine surgery, appear to be good substitutes, because they reduce tissue iatrogenic injury and hasten recovery. However, the effect of obesity on the performance of endoscopic spine surgery remains uncertain. This metaanalysis was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic spine surgery in patients with obesity compared with those without obesity. This study adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We conducted a thorough search using PubMed, Scopus, and Virtual Health Library. Methodological quality was assessed using the MINORS (Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies) criteria. Mean differences (MD) and standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Statistical analyses were conducted using Review manager ver. 5.4.1. Seven studies involving 659 participants were analyzed. The obese and nonobese groups had no significant differences in operative time (MD, 9.86 minutes; 95% CI, -4.93 to 24.65); Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for back pain at 3 months (MD, 0.26; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.63), 6 months (MD, 0.26; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.56), and 12 months (MD, -0.54; 95% CI, -1.70 to 0.62); VAS leg pain scores at 3 months (MD, 0.17; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.41), 6 months (MD, 0.23; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.59), and 12 months (MD, 0.18; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.45); Oswestry Disability Index scores at 3 months (MD, 1.02; 95% CI, -0.14 to 2.18) and 12 months (MD, 0.10; 95% CI, -1.14 to 1.33); and reherniation rate (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.73 to 2.49). Endoscopic surgery demonstrated no significant differences in outcomes between obese and nonobese patients and was safe and effective for this patient population.
