37663669,The analgesic efficacy of erector spinae plane block versus paravertebral block in thoracic surgeries: a meta-analysis.,"Acute postoperative pain after thoracic surgery might lead to chronic postsurgical pain (PSP), which lowers quality of life. The literature suggests thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) as a pain management approach. The ESPB (erector spinae plane block) is regarded to be an effective PVB alternative. The analgesic efficacy of the two analgesic therapies is controversial. The purpose of this study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of ESPB and PVB in preventing acute PSP. We searched relevant articles in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. The primary outcome was postoperative pain score, with secondary outcomes including analgesic consumption, the frequency of rescue analgesia, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. This meta-analysis included ten RCTs with a total of 670 patients. PVB significantly lowered the pain scores at movement at 12 h following surgery as compared to the ESPB. The PVB group used much less opioids within 24 h after surgery compared to the ESPB group. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of postoperative rescue analgesia or in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PVB produced superior analgesia than ESPB in patients who underwent thoracic surgeries. In addition, PVB demonstrated greater opioid sparing effect by consuming much less opioids.

37233969,Erector Spinae Plane Block Combined with Serratus Anterior Plane Block Versus Thoracic Paravertebral Block for Postoperative Analgesia and Recovery After Thoracoscopic Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Non-inferiority Clinical Trial.,"This study aimed to compare the postoperative analgesia and recovery of ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block combined with serratus anterior plane block (ESPB combined with SAPB) versus thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) after thoracoscopic surgery. Ninety-two patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) were randomly divided into group S (n=46) and group P (n=46). After anesthesia induction, the same anesthesiologist performed ultrasound-guided ESPB at T5 and T7 levels combined with SAPB at the level of the fifth rib in the midaxillary line in group S and ultrasound-guided PVB at T5 and T7 levels in group P. Patients in both groups were given 40 mL of 0.4% ropivacaine. Eighty-six patients completed the study (group S, n=44; group P, n=42). The morphine consumption, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at rest and coughing, and frequency of remedial analgesia were recorded at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h postoperatively. Pulmonary function parameters were recorded at 1, 4, and 24 h postoperatively, and the quality of recovery (QoR)-15 score at 24 h postoperatively. The adverse effects, duration of chest tube drainage and length of stay were also recorded. The morphine consumption at postoperative 4 and 8 h and the incidence of ipsilateral shoulder pain (ISP) were significantly lower in group S than in group P. The QoR-15 questionnaire score at postoperative 24 h was significantly lower in group P than in group S (P<0.05). The morphine consumption was lower at 24 h postoperatively in group S than in group P, with no significant difference found yet. The morphine consumption at other observed times, VAS scores, pulmonary function parameters, frequency of remedial analgesia, duration of chest tube drainage, length of stay, and incidence of other adverse events were comparable between group S and group P. Ultrasound-guided ESPB combined with SAPB is non-inferior to PVB in terms of morphine consumption at postoperative 24 h and postoperative recovery. But, this approach can significantly reduce morphine consumption in the early postoperative period (0-8 h) after thoracoscopy with lower incidence of ISP. It is a simpler and safer operation.",2023,Randomized Controlled Trial; Journal Article,"Humans; Pain, Postoperative; Nerve Block; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Analgesia; Morphine Derivatives",Mo X,10.1007/s11596-023-2745-2,0.167471,0.876664,0.000000,5,3,10,0.045543,2
37671541,Erector spinae plane block versus paravertebral block for postoperative pain management in thoracic surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The 2018 guidelines for enhanced recovery in thoracic surgery recommend paravertebral block (PVB) for postoperative pain management. However, recent studies demonstrate that erector spinae plane block (ESPB) achieves similar postoperative pain control with reduced block-related complications. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of ESPB versus PVB for pain management after thoracic surgery. PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched through December 2022 (PROSPERO registration - CRD42023395593). Primary outcomes were postoperative pain scores, resting at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours, and at movement at 24 and 48 hours. Secondary outcomes included opioid consumption at 24 and 48 hours, and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting or block-related complications in the first 48 hours. Ten randomized control trials enrolling a total of 624 total patients were included. There were no significant differences in pain scores, resting or at movement, at any time points except reduced resting pain scores at 12 hours with PVB (mean difference [MD]) 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 to 0.88). Opioid consumption demonstrated no significant differences at 24 hours; PVB reduced opioid consumption at 48 hours (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.89). There were no significant differences in postoperative nausea or vomiting. ESPB exhibited a nonsignificant trend toward reduced cumulative block-related complications (risk difference [RD] 0.05, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.00). Compared with PVB, ESPB is safe and demonstrates no clinically significant differences in pain management after thoracic surgery.",2023,Meta-Analysis; Systematic Review; Journal Article,"Humans; Thoracic Surgery; Analgesics, Opioid; Nerve Block; Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting; Pain, Postoperative; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",Capuano P,10.23736/S0375-9393.23.17510-9,0.154806,0.872626,0.000000,9,5,7,0.044803,3
34301447,Efficacy of Erector Spinae Plane Block for Analgesia in Thoracic Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The objective of this study was to determine whether erector spinae plane block (ESPB) can provide an effective analgesia for managing pain after thoracic surgery and compare the efficacy of ESPB with that of other regional analgesic techniques. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched. Patients undergoing thoracic surgeries. Erector spinae plane block with local anesthetics for postoperative analgesia. Seventeen studies, including 1,092 patients, were included in the final analysis. Erector spinae plane block reduced 24-hour postoperative opioid consumption (mean difference [MD] -17.49, 95% CI -26.87 to -8.12), pain score at rest (MD -0.82, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.33), and pain score at movement (MD -0.77, 95% CI -1.20 to -0.3) compared to no block. Compared with other regional blocks, various results have been observed. Although statistical results showed that ESPB is inferior to thoracic paravertebral block and intercostal nerve block and superior to serratus anterior plan block in postoperative analgesia, clinical differences remain unclear. The incidence of hematoma was lower in the ESPB group than in the other groups (odds ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.73). Erector spinae plane block may provide effective analgesia after thoracic surgery. Compared with other techniques, it is a safer method, without clinically important differences, for postoperative pain control. Therefore, ESPB may be considered as a valuable option for postoperative pain management after thoracic surgery.",2022,Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Review,"Analgesia; Humans; Nerve Block; Pain, Postoperative; Paraspinal Muscles; Thoracic Surgery",Koo CH,10.1053/j.jvca.2021.06.029,0.167112,0.872839,0.000000,6,4,18,0.043597,4

The primary outcome was to compare perioperative and postoperative (48 hours) opioid consumption. A total of 60 patients were randomized into two groups (N = 30): an ESPB group and an SAPB group. All the patients received intravenous patient-controlled postoperative analgesia and ibuprofen 400 mg intravenously every eight hours. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores, opioid consumption, and adverse events were recorded. Intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption at 0-8, 8-16, and 16-24 hours and rescue analgesic use were significantly lower in the ESPB group (P < 0.05). Static/dynamic VAS scores were significantly lower in the ESPB group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between static VAS scores at the fourth hour. There were no differences between adverse effects. Block procedure time and one-time puncture success were similar between groups (P  > 0.05 each). US-guided ESPB may provide better pain control than SAPB after VATS. Even though there are studies about analgesia management after VATS, clinicians want to perform the technique that is both less invasive and more effective.

35249833,The Effect of Erector Spinae Plane Block and Combined Deep and Superficial Serratus Anterior Plane Block on Acute Pain After Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Study.,"The study aimed to compare the analgesic effects of erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and a combination of the deep and superficial serratus anterior plane block (C-SAPB) methods in patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). A prospective, randomized study. At a single-center, high-volume, tertiary thoracic surgery center. Adult patients undergoing VATS. Ultrasound-guided ESPB and C-SAPB. Patients were assigned to ESPB (group 1) or C-SAPB (group 2) groups according to the analgesia protocol. All interventions were performed with single-needle insertion. Multimodal analgesia was achieved via paracetamol, dexketoprofen, and intravenous morphine for both study groups. Pain scores were assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS). Morphine consumption, rescue analgesic requirements, and side effects were recorded postoperatively for 24 hours. The primary outcome was determined as VAS scores at rest and coughing. The secondary outcomes of this study were postoperative morphine consumption and the requirement of rescue analgesics. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of VAS scores (p > 0.05). The groups also were similar in terms of demographic characteristics, side effects, morphine consumption, additional analgesic use, and duration of block procedures (p > 0.05). There also were comparable results in terms of hemodynamic variables (p > 0.05). Patients who underwent VATS receiving ESPB or C-SAPB had similar pain scores, opioid consumption, and side effects during the first postoperative 24 hours. At the same time, the fact that the duration of the block procedure was similar in both groups showed that multisite serratus anterior plane block can be an effective alternative method in analgesic treatment after VATS, considering that it easily can be applied. The authors here think that C-SAPB can be a good alternative to ESPB because the outcomes of both applications are similar, and C-SAPB easily can be seen and applied with ultrasound.",2022,Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial,"Acute Pain; Adult; Humans; Morphine; Nerve Block; Pain, Postoperative; Prospective Studies; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted",Zengin M,10.1053/j.jvca.2022.01.048,0.192715,0.837606,0.000000,2,14,16,0.042800,8
37408302,Analgesic Efficacy of Combined Thoracic Paravertebral Block and Erector Spinae Plane Block for Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery: A Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial.,"BACKGROUND Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) and erector spinae plane block (ESPB) are widely used in video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). However, they have corresponding adverse effects, including hypotension for TPVB and unpredictable injectate spread in ESPB. An optimal perioperative analgesic strategy remains controversial. We investigated the effect of ultrasound-guided combined TPVB and ESPB (CTEB) for VATS. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 120 patients scheduled for thoracic surgery were randomized to receive either ultrasound-guided TPVB, ESPB, or CTEB preoperatively. Postoperative analgesia was achieved with sufentanil patient-controlled intravenous analgesia. The primary outcome was the static pain score at 2 h after surgery. RESULTS The static pain score 2 h postoperatively was significantly different among the 3 groups. This difference was statistically significant for Group ESPB vs Group TPVB (P=0.004), but not for Group ESPB vs Group CTEB (P=0.767), or Group TPVB vs Group CTEB (P=0.117). Group TPVB exhibited the highest incidence of hypotension among the 3 groups. More patients experienced a sensory loss in Groups TPVB and CTEB 30 min after the block performance. Patients receiving CTEB exhibited a lower incidence of chronic pain 6 months postoperatively than those in Group ESPB. CONCLUSIONS CTEB does not enhance the analgesic effect of ESPB in patients undergoing VATS; however, it may induce a faster sensory loss after nerve block and reduce the incidence of postoperative chronic pain compared with ESPB. CTEB may also help to reduce the incidence of intraoperative hypotension compared with TPVB.",2023,Randomized Controlled Trial; Journal Article,"Humans; Chronic Pain; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Prospective Studies; Analgesics; Hypotension; Nerve Block; Pain, Postoperative",Zhang L,10.12659/MSM.940247,0.149676,0.854526,0.000000,10,12,9,0.042667,9

Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a recently discovered blocking technique, and it has evidenced excellent postoperative analgesia for breast and thoracic surgery with fewer adverse reactions. However, there are controversies about the postoperative analgesic effects of the two analgesic techniques. To assess the analgesic effects of PVB versus ESPB in postoperative thoracic and breast surgery. We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases up to April 5, 2021. The primary outcome was postoperative pain scores. Secondary outcomes included: opioid consumption, additional analgesia, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) 24 hours post-operation, and the time required for completing block procedure. This study was registered in PROSPERO, number CRD42021246160. After screening relevant, full-text articles, ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved for this meta-analysis. Six studies involved thoracic surgery patients, and four included breast surgery patients. Thoracic surgery studies included all of the outcomes involved in this meta-analysis while breast surgery did not report pain scores at movement and additional analgesia in 24 hours post-operation. For thoracic surgery, PVB resulted in significant reduction in the following pain scores: 0-1 hours (MD = -0.79, 95% CI: -1.54 to -0.03, P = 0.04), 4-6 hours (MD = -0.31, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.05, P = 0.02), and 24 hours (MD = -0.42, 95% CI: -0.81 to -0.02, P = 0.04) at rest; significant reduction in pain scores at 4-6 hours (MD = -0.47, 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.01, P = 0.04), 8-12 hours (MD = -1.09, 95% CI: -2.13 to -0.04, P = 0.04), and 24 hours (MD = -0.31, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.06, P = 0.01) at movement. Moreover, the opioid consumption at 24 hours post-operation (MD = -2.74, 95% CI: -5.41 to -0.07, P = 0.04) and the incidence of additional analgesia in 24 hours of the postoperative course (RR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.97, P = 0.04) were significantly lower in the PVB group than in the ESPB group for thoracic surgery. However, no significant differences were found in pain scores at rest at various time points postoperatively, and opioid consumption at 24 hours post-operation for breast surgery. The time required for completing block procedure was longer in the PVB group than in the ESPB group for thoracic and breast surgery, and the incidence of PONV between the two groups showed no significant difference.

The analgesic efficacy of erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) in terms of postoperative opioid consumption in uniportal thoracoscopic surgery still needs further studies. A randomized controlled trial was conducted, enrolling 150 patients who underwent uniportal thoracoscopic lobectomy. The patients were randomly allocated to three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: the ESPB group (administered 20 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine), the SAPB group (administered 20 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine), and the standard care (control) group. The primary endpoint was the consumption of sufentanil during the first 24 h following surgery. Secondary endpoints assessed the area under the curve (AUC) of pain numerical rating scale (NRS) scores, occurrence of moderate to severe pain, time to initial sufentanil request, and postoperative adverse events. No significant difference was observed in the consumption of sufentanil during the first 24 h following surgery between the ESPB and SAPB groups (adjusted difference, 1.53 [95% CI, -5.15 to 2.08]). However, in comparison to the control group, both intervention groups demonstrated a significant decrease in sufentanil consumption, with adjusted differences of -9.97 [95% CI, -13.10 to -6.84] for the ESPB group and -12.55 [95% CI, -15.63 to -9.47] for the SAPB group. There were no significant differences in AUC of NRS scores during rest and movement between the ESPB and SAPB groups, with adjusted differences of -7.10 [95% CI, 1.33 to -15.55] for the rest condition and 5.61 [95% CI, -13.23 to 2.01] for the movement condition. At 6 h postoperatively, there were fewer patients with moderate to severe pain in the ESPB group compared with those in the SAPB group (adjusted difference, -1.37% [95% CI, -2.29% to -0.45%]. The time to first sufentanil request significantly differed among the three groups (ESPB vs Control P < 0.01, SAPB vs Control P < 0.01, ESPB vs SAPB P = 0.015). In patients undergoing uniportal thoracoscopic lobectomy, although the differences between the two groups are not statistically significant, both the ESPB and SAPB demonstrate effective reduction in postoperative opioid consumption and the need for rescue analgesics compared to the control group. Moreover, the ESPB group experienced a significantly lower incidence of moderate to severe pain at 6 h postoperatively compared to the SAPB group.

36109206,"Postoperative recovery with continuous erector spinae plane block or video-assisted paravertebral block after minimally invasive thoracic surgery: a prospective, randomised controlled trial.","PROcedure SPECific Postoperative Pain ManagemenT (PROSPECT) guidelines recommend erector spinae plane (ESP) block or paravertebral block (PVB) for postoperative analgesia after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). However, there are few trials comparing the effectiveness of these techniques on patient-centric outcomes, and none evaluating chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP). Furthermore, there are no available trials comparing ultrasound-guided ESP with surgically placed PVB in this patient cohort. We conducted a two-centre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, controlled trial, comparing anaesthesiologist-administered, ultrasound-guided ESP catheter with surgeon-administered, video-assisted PVB catheter analgesia among 80 adult patients undergoing VATS. Participants received a 20 ml bolus of levobupivacaine 0.375% followed by infusion of levobupivacaine 0.15% (10-15 ml h Median (25-75%) QoR-15 at 24 h was higher in ESP (n=37) compared with PVB (n=37): 118 (106-134) vs 110 (89-121) (P=0.03) and at 48 h: 131 (121-139) vs 120 (111-133) (P=0.03). There were no differences in peak inspiratory flow, AUC, Comprehensive Complication Index, length of hospital stay, and opioid consumption. Incidence of CPSP at 3 months was 12 (34%) for ESP and 11 (31%) for PVB (P=0.7).

We investigated whether intravenous dexamethasone with dexmedetomidine after erector spinae plane block and serratus anterior plane block could further decrease the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain. A total of 81 patients were randomly assigned to group C (20 mL normal saline), group S (10 mg dexamethasone + normal saline to 20 mL), or group SM (10 mg dexamethasone + 1 µg/kg dexmedetomidine + normal saline to 20 mL). All patients underwent erector spinae plane block and serratus anterior plane block 30 min before anesthesia induction and all drugs were infused intravenously 30 min after general anesthesia induction. The primary outcome was incidence of moderate-to-severe pain at 24 h on movement postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included incidence of moderate-to-severe pain on movement and at rest throughout the first two postoperative days, pain score, opioid consumption, quality of recovery and adverse effects. Group SM lowered the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain on movement at 24 h postoperatively than group C (11.1% vs. 48.0%; RR 0.231; 95% CI, 0.074 to 0.725) and group S (11.1% vs. 38.5%; RR 0.289; 95% CI, 0.089 to 0.933). Group SM reduced NRS score on movement (3.0 [3.0] vs. 3.0 [2.0] vs. 3.0[1.0]; P < 0.001) and total opioid consumption (26.0 [6.0] vs. 32.0 [9.0] vs. 28.0 [2.5]; P = 0.004) within 24 h after surgery, fewer patients required rescue analgesia (11.1% vs. 48.0% vs. 38.5%; P = 0.009). Group SM also lowered incidence of nausea and vomiting (7.4% vs. 32.0% vs. 30.8%; P = 0.047) and had a higher QoR-15 score at postoperative 24 h (132.0 [10.0] vs. 123.0 [8.0] vs. 127.5 [10.8]; P < 0.001). Intravenous administration of dexamethasone with dexmedetomidine after erector spinae plane block and serratus anterior plane block further decreased the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain.

Single blinded, randomized, controlled trial. The study was carried out at the National Cancer Institute in Cairo, Egypt. Fifty-one patients with cancer. Patients were allocated randomly into three groups: thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) group, serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) group, and erector spinae plane block (ESPB) group. Outcome measures were 24 hours postoperative visual analog scale (VAS), intraoperative rescue fentanyl consumption, perioperative heart rate, mean blood pressure (mean arterial pressure [MAP]), and total postoperative morphine consumption. VAS scores at rest were significantly lower in the TEA group at the postanesthesia care unit and 24 hours. VAS scores with cough were significantly higher in the SAPB group at eight and 24 hours. The first time to receive morphine was significantly longer in the TEA group. No patients in the TEA group required postoperative morphine, whereas 88.2% and 47.1% required morphine in the SAPB and ESPB groups, respectively, p < 0.001. In the TEA group, intraoperative MAP values were lower than the other two groups, p < 0.05.

Prospective, randomized, single-blind study. University hospital, single institution. Adult patients undergoing VATS. Ultrasonography-guided ESPB, ultrasonography-guided TPVB, or ICNB. Patients were enrolled into the following three groups according to analgesia technique as ESPB, TPVB, or ICNB, respectively, group erector spinae plane block (GESP) (n = 35), group thoracic paravertebral block (GTPV) (n = 35), and group intercostal nerve block (GICN) (n = 36). Multimodal analgesia was achieved with paracetamol, tenoxicam, and intravenous morphine (via patient-controlled analgesia) for all study groups. Pain scores were assessed by visual analog scale, and morphine consumption, rescue analgesic requirement, and side effects were recorded postoperatively. Dynamic visual analog scale at the first hour as primary outcome was determined five (two-seven), four (one-six) and (two-six) in GESP, GTPV, and GICN, respectively. Dynamic pain scores were significantly lower in GTPV compared with GESP and GICN at 24 hours (p < 0.017). Dynamic pain scores in GICN were significantly lower at 12 hours compared with GESP (p < 0.017). Morphine consumption for the first 24 hours was similar in GICN and GTPV, and it was significantly lower in GICN and GTPV in comparison to GESP (p < 0.017).

39621976,Regional Analgesia Techniques Following Thoracic Surgery: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.,"Regional analgesia techniques have become the basis of multimodal analgesia for acute and chronic pain. They are widely used in thoracic surgery, but the best treatment is still uncertain. We aimed to compare and rank the effectiveness of regional analgesia techniques for thoracic surgery. A systematic review and network meta-analysis. PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Science-Direct, and Web of Science were searched for articles published from inception through the end of January 2023. The network meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 15.1 software (StataCorp, LLC). The certainty of evidence was assessed by using Confidence in Network Meta-analysis (CINeMA https://cinema.ispm.unibe.ch/ A (unibe.ch). The primary outcome was cumulative opioid consumption within postoperative 24 hours. The secondary outcomes included pain scores at postoperative 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours. A total of 32 trials with 1,996 patients and 11 techniques were included. No major network inconsistency or heterogeneity were found. Postoperative opioid consumption within postoperative 24 hours was decreased most by continuous extrapleural block (cEPB) (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.00; 95% CI,: 0.00-0.00), followed by continuous thoracic epidural analgesia (cTEA) and continuous serratus plane block (cSAPB). In the postoperative 6 hour analysis, pain scores were  decreased most by cTEA (SMD = 0.16; 95% CI,: 0.05-0.49), followed by thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) and ESPB (erector spinae plane block). In the postoperative 12 hour analysis, pain scores were decreased most by cSAPB (SMD = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.011.84), followed by TPVB and cTEA. In the postoperative 24 hour analysis, pain scores were decreased most by ESPB (SMD = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.030.32), followed by cSAPB and continuous thoracic paravertebral block (cTPVB). Our study has several limitations. First, 4 enrolled studies had a sample size of less than 40 patients. Second, the different regimens were potential factors contributing to heterogeneity, such as local anesthetic dose and volume, infusion time, infusion mode, adding adjuncts, and rescue analgesic regimens. Third, the number of primary and secondary outcomes is limited. Fourth, the number of randomized controlled trials for cEPB is limited. The cTEA and cSAPB techniques are more likely to reduce the cumulative opioid consumption within 24 hours. The cTEA, cSAPB, ESPB techniques were more likely to improve pain at postoperative 6, 12, and 24 hours. Therefore, cTEA, cSAPB, and ESPB are the first choices for pain relief post thoracic surgery, whereas wound infiltration, intercostal block, continuous wound infiltration, and continuous intercostal block were less likely to be effective.

We performed a RCT enrolling participants scheduled for uVATS (Trial registration: NCT06016777; registration date: Aug 28, 2023). Participants were randomized for thoracic paravertebral block combined with patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PVB + PCIA), erector spinae block combined with PCIA (ESPB + PCIA), or PCIA group. Participants were followed-up till 6 months. Primary outcome was total opioid consumption. Secondary outcomes included postoperative rest and cough pain scores, ambulation time, chest tube duration, length of stay, anaesthesia expense and adverse events. We enrolled 108 participants between October 16th, 2023 to April 14th, 2024. Neural block did not reduce opioid consumption. Postoperative rest and cough pain scores did not differ among the groups at all the follow-up time points. None of the participants experienced chronic pain. The ambulation time, duration of chest tube maintenance and length of stay did not differ among groups. Duration of anaesthesia procedure was significantly prolonged in both neural blockade groups compared to PCIA group (p = 0.033). Anaesthesia expenses were significantly higher in both nerve block groups than in the PCIA group (p < 0.001). Adverse events related to neural blockade occurred in 17.9% in PVB + PCIA group and 2.9% in ESPB + PCIA group (p = 0.010), including local haemorrhage and block failure. Adverse events related to opioid use did not differ among groups. Both PVB and ESPB did not exhibit analgesic advantage for uVATS.

We searched PubMed, Embase, Medline, Springer, Google Scholar, and Web of Science to evaluate all relevant randomized controlled trials that investigated the analgesic effects of different regional analgesia methods for VATS published through July 2021. After a comprehensive search of electronic databases, the following methods were identified: epidural analgesia (EA), local anesthetics (LA), superficial serratus anterior plane block (SSAPB), deep serratus anterior plane block (DSAPB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), paravertebral block (PVB), and intercostal nerve block (ICNB). Primary outcomes were the visual analog scale score at rest, at 2 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were postoperative analgesic consumption, incidence of nausea and emesis, and pruritus. Overall, 35 trials met our inclusion criteria. EA and PVB were relatively more advantageous in terms of analgesic effect at 2 hours and 6 hours postoperatively; the EA group was superior to the DSAPB, ESPB, and ICNB groups at 24 hours postoperatively. EA was found to be superior to other analgesia techniques for 24 hour postoperative analgesic consumption., PVB showed advantages in reducing postoperative nausea, emesis, and pruritus. Different concentrations and volumes of local anesthetics might affect the analgesic effects of the various analgesia techniques.
