For resting VAS at 6 h, there was no significant difference between PVB and ESPB (mean difference [MD] = -0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.44 to 0.27). For QoR, there was no significant difference between PVB and ESPB (MD = -0.44, 95% CI: -2.64 to 1.76). For resting VAS at 12 h, ESPB had a lower VAS than PVB.

However, PVB had a lower morphine consumption than ESPB. There were no significant clinical differences between PVB and ESPB in terms of the VAS, QoR, time of first rescue analgesia, LOS, and PONV. Based on existing evidences, we recommended the application of ESPB in thoracic surgery, breast surgery, kidney surgery, and abdominal surgery.

This review systematically examines evidence published between 1 January 2014, and 1 January 2025, regarding the clinical efficacy, anatomical mechanisms, and complication profiles of ESPB and PVB, with a specific focus on their application in video-assisted thoracoscopic and breast surgery. Both ESPB and PVB significantly reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption compared to controls (p<0.05), thereby minimizing opioid-related complications. However, important controversies persist over their comparative analgesic performance and safety. Some studies report that PVB may provide superior analgesia, but it also carries a higher risk of complications, such as hematoma (2 cases in the PVB group, none in the ESPB group) and pneumothorax (observed with PVB but not reported with ESPB). ESPB is therefore considered safer due to its lower complication rate. Anatomical investigations reveal that ESPB exhibits multidirectional spread of local anesthetic: (1) cranio-caudal along the fascial plane, increasing the number of dermatomes covered and expanding the area of analgesia; (2) medial spread to the paravertebral space, which may enhance blockade of the ventral rami and improve analgesic reliability; (3) lateral diffusion toward the intercostal spaces, potentially influencing chest wall sensation; (4) spread to the dorsal rami, contributing to posterior thoracic analgesia; and (5) limited anterior extension, which has implications for the consistency of ventral ramus blockade. The clinical significance of these spread directions lies in their impact on the quality, extent, and predictability of analgesia, as well as the potential for reducing procedure-related risks compared to PVB. Given current uncertainties in anatomy and outcomes, immediate research priorities should include developing individualized ESPB protocols that account for anatomical variation and total local anesthetic dose, and validating these approaches through multicenter randomized trials. By clarifying these issues, this review aims to provide clinicians with focused, up-to-date evidence to guide block selection, optimize perioperative outcomes, and support the standardization of regional anesthesia protocols.", "year": 2025, "pubtypes": ["Journal Article"], "mesh": [], "first_author": "Zhang Y", "doi": "10.1097/JS9.0000000000003135"}

Regional anesthesia can help achieve greater pain control, fostering enhanced recovery and increased patient satisfaction, though debate remains over the most effective technique for VATS.

This study also sought to identify the clinical benefits of regional anesthesia (CSAPB or CESPB) versus no regional anesthesia in the setting of VATS. A retrospective study was conducted, including 397 adult patients who underwent VATS and received multimodal analgesia. Postoperative outcomes were compared among patients who received CSAPB versus those who received CESPB; these outcomes were also compared between patients who received either regional anesthesia technique (CSAPB or CESPB, block group) and patients who did not receive regional anesthesia (non-block group). Co-primary outcomes included opioid consumption during hospital admission (presented as morphine milligram equivalents) and pain (minimum, maximum, and average numeric pain scale scores) in the first 72 postoperative hours. Secondary postoperative outcomes included post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay, time from procedure end to discharge, time to first opioid medication, ambulation distance on day one, medication use, and incidence of surgical or block-related complications. All data were retrospectively obtained from patients' electronic medical records. Comparing regional anesthesia techniques, patients who received CESPB reported lower pain with activity postoperatively than patients who received CSAPB (3.6 vs. 4.2, p=0.009). There were no other significant differences in postoperative outcomes between these groups. Comparing the block and non-block groups, the block group exhibited a higher overall comorbidity burden than the non-block group (p=0.001). Even so, the block group reported less postoperative pain at rest and with activity than the non-block group (mean: 3.6 vs. 4.1, p=0.012; mean 3.8 vs. 4.4, p=0.012).

Both CESPB and CSAPB are effective regional anesthesia techniques for VATS postoperative pain management with clear clinical benefits over no regional anesthesia.

{"pmid": 38826942, "title": "Comparison of Postoperative Opioid Consumption of Paravertebral Block and Erector Spinae Plane Block After Thoracotomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.", "abstract": "Background Thoracotomy is associated with severe postoperative pain. Pain developing after thoracotomy causes lung infections, inability to expel secretions, and atelectasis as a result of deep breathing. Effective management of acute pain after thoracotomy may prevent these complications. A multimodal approach to analgesia is widely employed by thoracic anesthetists using a combination of regional anesthetic blockade and systemic analgesia, with both non-opioid and opioid medications and local anesthesia blockade. Nowadays, regional anesthesia techniques such as thoracic epidural paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), and serratus plane block are frequently used to prevent pain after thoracotomy. In this study, we compared paravertebral block with erector spinae block for pain relief after thoracotomy. Our primary aim was to determine whether there was a difference between postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores. We also compared the two regional anesthesia techniques in terms of intraoperative hemodynamic data and postoperative complications. Methodology Patients aged between 18 and 75 years with an American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status I-III and scheduled for elective thoracotomy were included in the study. Using www.randomizer.org, patients were divided into two different groups, namely, ESPB and PVB. All patients were provided with a patient-controlled analgesia device preloaded with morphine. Postoperative 24-hour morphine consumptions were recorded. Results Data from 45 patients were used in the final analyses. Morphine consumption was higher in the ESPB group than in the PVB group at 24 hours postoperatively (19.2 ± 4.26 mg and 16.2 ± 2.64 mg, respectively; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in numerical rating scale scores both at rest and with coughing (p > 0.05). Intraoperative heart rates were similar between groups. However, mean intraoperative blood pressure was significantly lower in the PVB group at 30 minutes (p < 0.05). Nausea and vomiting were observed in two patients in the ESPB group and one patient in the PVB group. The complication of nausea and vomiting was not statistically significant between the two groups (p > 0.05). Catastrophic complications such as hematoma, pneumothorax, and local anesthetic systemic toxicity were not observed in either group. Conclusions We found that patients who underwent PVB consumed less morphine postoperatively than patients who underwent ESPB. However, we did not observe any difference in pain scores between both groups. We think that ESPB can be considered a reliable method in thoracotomy surgery due to its ease of application and the fact that the place where the block is technically performed is farther from the central structures compared to PVB. In light of the results of our study, ESPB can be used as an alternative to PVB, which has been proven as postoperative analgesia in thoracic surgery.", "year": 2024, "pubtypes": ["Journal Article"], "mesh": [], "first_author": "Duran M", "doi": "10.7759/cureus.59459"}

Previous studies have shown the ESP block can be easily adapted to abdominal procedures at the corresponding dermatome level and provide postoperative analgesia. Though the versatility, simplicity, and safety of the ESP block have been demonstrated, there is a gap in the literature regarding its comparison between thoracic and abdominal surgeries. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the ESP block in treating acute postoperative pain in patients undergoing thoracic and abdominal surgeries. Methods This retrospective study included 50 patients in the non-cardiac thoracic surgery group (bilateral breast mastectomy with reconstruction) and 50 patients in the abdominal surgery group (robotic or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy). Data was obtained via the acute pain service records at a tertiary care center from 2018 to 2022. All patients received bilateral ESP blocks, performed under ultrasound guidance. Various parameters were evaluated including oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores during post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), 6, 12, and 24 hours postop. The use of abortive antiemetic medications within 24 hours was also measured to evaluate the incidence of nausea and vomiting. The results were analyzed and compared. No control group is included, as all patients at our institution receive a peripheral nerve block as a part of the institution's enhanced recovery pathway (ERP). Results This retrospective study included 50 patients in the non-cardiac thoracic surgery group (bilateral breast mastectomy with reconstruction) and 50 patients in the abdominal surgery group (robotic or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy). Compared to the thoracic group, the abdominal group had a statistically higher VAS score in PACU with mean difference (MD) 1.3 VAS, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-2.56, p-value 0.0443, statistically higher OME consumption in the PACU (difference 13.35 OME, 95% CI 4.97-21.73, p-value 0.0003), and required significantly more antiemetic pharmacotherapy (mean 1.4 antiemetics administered, 95% CI 0.84-2.04, p-value <0.0001). Despite the abdominal group having more OME utilization in the PACU, there was no difference in cumulative OME use in the first 24 hours (95% CI -9.745-24.10, p-value 0.4021). Conclusion In this study, we demonstrated that ESP blocks are an effective regional anesthesia technique to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption. The ESP block can serve as a useful and safe alternative to either thoracic epidural or paravertebral block techniques in thoracic and upper abdominal surgeries for perioperative pain management.", "year": 2024, "pubtypes": ["Journal Article"], "mesh": [], "first_author": "Hymes-Green Z", "doi": "10.7759/cureus.58926"}

The analgesic efficacy of erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) in terms of postoperative opioid consumption in uniportal thoracoscopic surgery still needs further studies. A randomized controlled trial was conducted, enrolling 150 patients who underwent uniportal thoracoscopic lobectomy. The patients were randomly allocated to three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: the ESPB group (administered 20 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine), the SAPB group (administered 20 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine), and the standard care (control) group. The primary endpoint was the consumption of sufentanil during the first 24 h following surgery. Secondary endpoints assessed the area under the curve (AUC) of pain numerical rating scale (NRS) scores, occurrence of moderate to severe pain, time to initial sufentanil request, and postoperative adverse events. No significant difference was observed in the consumption of sufentanil during the first 24 h following surgery between the ESPB and SAPB groups (adjusted difference, 1.53 [95% CI, -5.15 to 2.08]).

However, they have corresponding adverse effects, including hypotension for TPVB and unpredictable injectate spread in ESPB. An optimal perioperative analgesic strategy remains controversial. We investigated the effect of ultrasound-guided combined TPVB and ESPB (CTEB) for VATS. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 120 patients scheduled for thoracic surgery were randomized to receive either ultrasound-guided TPVB, ESPB, or CTEB preoperatively. Postoperative analgesia was achieved with sufentanil patient-controlled intravenous analgesia. The primary outcome was the static pain score at 2 h after surgery. RESULTS The static pain score 2 h postoperatively was significantly different among the 3 groups. This difference was statistically significant for Group ESPB vs Group TPVB (P=0.004), but not for Group ESPB vs Group CTEB (P=0.767), or Group TPVB vs Group CTEB (P=0.117). Group TPVB exhibited the highest incidence of hypotension among the 3 groups. More patients experienced a sensory loss in Groups TPVB and CTEB 30 min after the block performance. Patients receiving CTEB exhibited a lower incidence of chronic pain 6 months postoperatively than those in Group ESPB. CONCLUSIONS CTEB does not enhance the analgesic effect of ESPB in patients undergoing VATS; however, it may induce a faster sensory loss after nerve block and reduce the incidence of postoperative chronic pain compared with ESPB.

Primary outcomes were the visual analog scale score at rest, at 2 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were postoperative analgesic consumption, incidence of nausea and emesis, and pruritus. Overall, 35 trials met our inclusion criteria. EA and PVB were relatively more advantageous in terms of analgesic effect at 2 hours and 6 hours postoperatively; the EA group was superior to the DSAPB, ESPB, and ICNB groups at 24 hours postoperatively. EA was found to be superior to other analgesia techniques for 24 hour postoperative analgesic consumption., PVB showed advantages in reducing postoperative nausea, emesis, and pruritus. Different concentrations and volumes of local anesthetics might affect the analgesic effects of the various analgesia techniques. EA and PVB have certain advantages in analgesia, but the incidence of postoperative pruritus after EA is higher. At the same time, considering the risk of coagulation and puncture complications, PVB may be a better choice.", "year": 2022, "pubtypes": ["Systematic Review", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Network Meta-Analysis"], "mesh": ["Humans", "Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted", "Pain, Postoperative", "Anesthetics, Local", "Bayes Theorem", "Analgesia, Epidural", "Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting", "Analgesics", "Pruritus"], "first_author": "Zeng J", "doi": null}

After screening relevant, full-text articles, ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved for this meta-analysis. Six studies involved thoracic surgery patients, and four included breast surgery patients. Thoracic surgery studies included all of the outcomes involved in this meta-analysis while breast surgery did not report pain scores at movement and additional analgesia in 24 hours post-operation. For thoracic surgery, PVB resulted in significant reduction in the following pain scores: 0-1 hours (MD = -0.79, 95% CI: -1.54 to -0.03, P = 0.04), 4-6 hours (MD = -0.31, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.05, P = 0.02), and 24 hours (MD = -0.42, 95% CI: -0.81 to -0.02, P = 0.04) at rest; significant reduction in pain scores at 4-6 hours (MD = -0.47, 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.01, P = 0.04), 8-12 hours (MD = -1.09, 95% CI: -2.13 to -0.04, P = 0.04), and 24 hours (MD = -0.31, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.06, P = 0.01) at movement. Moreover, the opioid consumption at 24 hours post-operation (MD = -2.74, 95% CI: -5.41 to -0.07, P = 0.04) and the incidence of additional analgesia in 24 hours of the postoperative course (RR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.97, P = 0.04) were significantly lower in the PVB group than in the ESPB group for thoracic surgery. However, no significant differences were found in pain scores at rest at various time points postoperatively, and opioid consumption at 24 hours post-operation for breast surgery. The time required for completing block procedure was longer in the PVB group than in the ESPB group for thoracic and breast surgery, and the incidence of PONV between the two groups showed no significant difference. The postoperative analgesic effects of PVB versus ESPB are distinguished by the surgical site. For thoracic surgery, the postoperative analgesic effect of PVB is better than that of ESPB.

Secondary outcomes include accumulated morphine-equivalent consumption, postoperative pain scores, emergence agitation incidence, time of the first mobilization, time to first rescue analgesia, complications related to pain treatment, and morphine-related adverse events. This will the first randomized controlled trial to compare ESPB with TPVB for analgesia after pectus excavatum repair. This trial aims to provide important clinical evidence to elaborate on the analgesic mechanism of ESPB in children. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05034601 .

{"pmid": 33885016, "title": "A comparison of paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block and the combination of erector spinae plane block and paravertebral block for post-operative analgesia after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: A randomised controlled trial.", "abstract": "This study was to determine the analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and paravertebral block (PVB) as well as the combination of PVB and ESPB (P + E) after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Patients were randomly assigned to receive ESPB, PVB or PVB combined with ESPB with 0.5% ropivacaine (20 ml). The primary outcomes were cumulative hydromorphone consumption and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores at rest and while coughing at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were effective PCA usage count and rescue analgesia requirement at the same time points. The median (interquartile range) hydromorphone consumption, including converted oxycodone, was significantly different at 48 h postoperatively among the three groups (ESPB, 10.24 [9.53-11.71] mg; PVB, 9.94 [9.19-10.75] mg; P + E, 9.44 [8.96-9.97] mg; P = 0.011). Hydromorphone consumption in P + E group was lower compared with that in ESPB group at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h (P < 0.001, P = 0.004 and P = 0.003, respectively). VAS scores at rest were significantly higher for ESPB group compared to P + E group at 0 h postoperatively (P = 0.009). VAS scores while coughing were significantly higher for ESPB group compared to P + E group at 0 h and 12 h postoperatively (P = 0.015 and P < 0.001) and to the PVB group at 12 h postoperatively (P = 0.002). The effective PCA usage count in P + E group was lower than in ESPB group in 0-12 h (P < 0.001). More patients needed rescue analgesia in ESPB group compared to those in P + E group in 0-12 h, 0-24 h and 0-48 h (P = 0.022, 0.035 and 0.035, respectively). Ultrasound-guided PVB combined with ESPB provided superior analgesia to ESPB for VATS. The combination of PVB and ESPB had a similar analgesic effect compared with PVB alone.", "year": 2022, "pubtypes": ["Journal Article"], "mesh": [], "first_author": "Fu Z", "doi": "10.4103/jmas.JMAS_277_20"}
