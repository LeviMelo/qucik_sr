        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract biomedical terms from the given NLQ. First, I need to understand each section: population, intervention, comparators, outcomes, must_have, and avoid.\n\nStarting with population. The NLQ says adults undergoing minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (Nuss/MIRPE). So synonyms for that. MIRPE and Nuss are already mentioned. Maybe \"adults with pectus excavatum\" or \"patients undergoing minimally invasive pectus repair\". Also, \"postoperative\" might be relevant since it's about after surgery. But wait, the example in the template includes \"adults undergoing minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (Nuss/MIRPE)\", so maybe I should include that exact phrase? Or synonyms. Let me check the output policy: prefer standard medical terms and common acronyms. So MIRPE and Nuss are key here. Also, \"minimally invasive repair\" is part of the intervention, but for population, maybe \"adults with pectus excavatum\" or \"patients undergoing minimally invasive pectus repair\". But the example in the problem statement includes \"adults undergoing minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (Nuss/MIRPE)\" as a possible entry. So perhaps that's one term. Also, maybe \"postoperative\" if relevant, but the NLQ specifies the population as those undergoing the surgery. Hmm.\n\nNext, intervention: intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) used intraoperatively for analgesia during Nuss/MIRPE. The example includes \"cryoanalgesia\", \"INC\", and \"intercostal nerve cryoablation\". Also, maybe \"intraoperative cryoablation\" or \"cryoanesthesia\"? But the key terms here are INC, cryoablation, intercostal nerve. So possible entries: \"intercostal nerve cryoablation\", \"cryoanalgesia\", \"INC\", and maybe \"intraoperative cryoablation\".\n\nComparators: thoracic epidural, paravertebral block, intercostal nerve block, erector spinae plane block, systemic multimodal analgesia. The NLQ lists these as comparators. So those are the exact terms. But need to check if there are common variants. For example, \"thoracic epidural\" is already listed. Maybe \"paravertebral blockade\"? Or \"intercostal nerve block\" vs \"intercostal block\". But the problem says to include common phrasings. The original list includes all the exact terms, so maybe those are the ones.\n\nOutcomes: postoperative opioid consumption (in-hospital and at discharge) and pain scores within 0–7 days. Common phrasings could be \"postoperative opioid use\", \"opioid consumption\", \"pain scores in first week\", \"acute postoperative pain\". Also, \"in-hospital opioid use\" or \"discharge opioid use\". But the NLQ specifies \"postoperative opioid consumption (in-hospital and at discharge)\" so maybe include that exact phrase. Also \"pain scores within 7 days\".\n\nMust_have: 3-6 anchor tokens. The example mentions MIRPE, Nuss, cryoablation. So those are key terms. Also, the intervention is INC, so maybe include \"INC\", \"cryoablation\", \"Nuss\". But the NLQ says \"must_have\" should be 3-6. Let's check: MIRPE, Nuss, cryoablation, and maybe \"intercostal nerve cryoablation\"? Or perhaps \"cryoanalgesia\"? Wait, the must_have is to ensure topicality. The key terms from the NLQ are MIRPE, Nuss, INC (cryoablation). So maybe those three? But the example in the problem statement includes MIRPE, Nuss, cryoablation as must_have. Let me check the original NLQ: \"must_have: 3–6 anchor tokens that should appear to ensure topicality (e.g., MIRPE, Nuss, cryoablation).\" So those three are examples. So include MIRPE, Nuss, and cryoablation.\n\nAvoid: 3-6 obvious confounders. The example says e.g., pediatric oncology, cardiac surgery. But the NLQ's context is about pectus excavatum repair. So avoid terms related to other surgeries or conditions. For instance, \"pediatric\", \"cardiac\", \"oncology\", \"orthopedic\" (if not relevant), but maybe \"thoracic surgery\" if it's a confounder? Wait, the NLQ is about pectus excavatum repair, so avoid terms that are unrelated. The example says to avoid things like pediatric oncology, cardiac surgery. So in this case, perhaps \"pediatric\", \"cardiac\", \"oncologic\", or \"orthopedic\" if they're not relevant. But the NLQ is about adults, so maybe \"pediatric\" is a confounder. Also, \"thoracic surgery\" might be a comparator, but since comparators are already listed, perhaps avoid terms that are too broad. Maybe \"cardiac\", \"oncologic\", \"pediatric\". So those three.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nPopulation: adults undergoing minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (Nuss/MIRPE), adults with pectus excavatum, postoperative patients with pectus excavatum. Wait, but the NLQ says population is adults undergoing the surgery. Maybe \"adults undergoing minimally invasive pectus repair\" and \"patients with pectus excavatum\". Also, maybe \"postoperative\" if relevant, but the population is those undergoing the procedure. So perhaps include \"adults undergoing minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (Nuss/MIRPE)\" as one term, then \"adults with pectus excavatum\", and \"patients undergoing minimally invasive pectus repair\".\n\nIntervention: intercostal nerve cryoablation, cryoanalgesia, INC, intraoperative cryoablation.\n\nComparators: thoracic epidural, paravertebral block, intercostal nerve block, erector spinae plane block, systemic multimodal analgesia. The NLQ lists these exactly, so include them as is.\n\nOutcomes: postoperative opioid consumption (in-hospital and at discharge), pain scores within 7 days, postoperative opioid use, acute postoperative pain scores.\n\nMust_have: MIRPE, Nuss, cryoablation.\n\nAvoid: pediatric, cardiac, oncologic.\n\nWait, but the avoid list should be 3-6 terms. The example says e.g., pediatric oncology, cardiac surgery. So maybe \"pediatric\", \"cardiac\", \"oncologic\" as three terms. Alternatively, \"thoracic surgery\", \"orthopedic\", etc. But the NLQ is about pectus excavatum repair, so avoid terms that are not related. Maybe \"pediatric\", \"cardiac\", \"oncologic\".\n\nSo final check:\n\nPopulation: [\"adults undergoing minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (Nuss/MIRPE)\", \"adults with pectus excavatum\", \"patients undergoing minimally invasive pectus repair\"]\n\nIntervention: [\"intercostal nerve cryoablation\", \"cryoanalgesia\", \"INC\", \"intraoperative cryoablation\"]\n\nComparators: [\"thoracic epidural\", \"paravertebral block\", \"intercostal nerve block\", \"erector spinae plane block\", \"systemic multimodal analgesia\"]\n\nOutcomes: [\"postoperative opioid consumption (in-hospital and at discharge)\", \"pain scores within 7 days\", \"postoperative opioid use\", \"acute postoperative pain scores\"]\n\nMust_have: [\"MIRPE\", \"Nuss\", \"cryoablation\"]\n\nAvoid: [\"pediatric\", \"cardiac\", \"oncologic\"]\n\nBut need to check if the arrays are between 2-10 items. Population has three, intervention four, comparators five, outcomes four, must_have three, avoid three. That fits.\n\nNow, make sure that all terms are plain phrases without any brackets or tags. Also, check for standard medical terms. For example, \"systemic multimodal analgesia\" is correct. \"Erector spinae plane block\" is a known term. \"Cryoanalgesia\" is acceptable as an acronym. \"INC\" is the abbreviation for intercostal nerve cryoablation.\n\nYes, this should meet the requirements.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"population\": [\n    \"adults undergoing minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (Nuss/MIRPE)\",\n    \"patients with pectus excavatum\",\n    \"postoperative patients with pectus excavatum\"\n  ],\n  \"intervention\": [\n    \"intercostal nerve cryoablation\",\n    \"cryoanalgesia\",\n    \"INC\",\n    \"intraoperative cryoablation\"\n  ],\n  \"comparators\": [\n    \"thoracic epidural\",\n    \"paravertebral block\",\n    \"intercostal nerve block\",\n    \"erector spinae plane block\",\n    \"systemic multimodal analgesia\"\n  ],\n  \"outcomes\": [\n    \"postoperative opioid consumption (in-hospital and at discharge)\",\n    \"pain scores within 7 days\",\n    \"postoperative opioid use\",\n    \"acute postoperative pain scores\"\n  ],\n  \"must_have\": [\n    \"MIRPE\",\n    \"Nuss\",\n    \"cryoablation\"\n  ],\n  \"avoid\": [\n    \"pediatric\",\n    \"cardiac\",\n    \"oncologic\"\n  ]\n}"
